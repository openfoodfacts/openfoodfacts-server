<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>Open Food Facts is a non-profit open source and open data project with a massive impact on the food and health of millions of people across the world, and we need your help to make this impact even bigger in many more parts of the world!</p>
<p>Open Food Facts is going to be a candidate organization for the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code 2021</a>.</p>


<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>If you would like to work on Open Food Facts projects during the Google Summer of Code, make sure to <a href="https://slack.openfoodfacts.org">join the Open Food Facts community on Slack</a>, introduce yourself there and get familiar with the project.</p>

<p>A good way to do that is to open your fridge or cupboard to find a food item to scan with our Android or iOS application. Open Food Facts works like Wikipedia. The food product may already be in the database with its data completed. If it’s present, you will get valuable information about its nutritional quality (Nutri-Score) or its level of food processing (NOVA). If it’s not present yet, please take some pictures and add it!</p>


<h2>Areas where your help can make a big difference</h2>

<p>Open Food Facts does many things like food products data acquisition and analysis on the backend, data visualization on the Open Food Facts website and mobile apps. This page presents the major systems and the technology they use, and the current challenges you could help us address during GSOC.</p>

<h3>&rarr; Open Food Facts native Android and iOS apps</h3>

<p>Our native apps are used by 1 million users every month to scan food products, decrypt their labels, compare their nutritional quality, to get alerts on allergens, and also to add and edit products in the Open Food Facts database.</p>

</ul>

<h3>&rarr; All new cross-platform Flutter app to reach an even broader user base</h3>

<p>Our existing native apps put a lot of emphasis on features to contribute photos and data to the Open Food Facts database. We want to reach a much larger audience of users who are primarily interested in using our food products data to make better choices, and gradually incite them to also contribute. This new app will be much more focused on user experience and ease of use for people who are not (yet) core contributors to the project.</p>

<p><b>Our challenges:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Flawless design and useful features</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Key point:</b> We are starting from a clean state, which gives us the opportunity to design a perfect app from all perspectives: the right set of features, the most intuitive design, the best architecture choices, and the most effective development model. This will be a very exciting team effort!</p>

<h3>&rarr; Robotoff</h3>

<p>Robotoff is our system to extract valuable information out of the many images contributors send us. It uses a mix of classic techniques (such as regular expressions on the output of Google Cloud Vision OCR) and machine learning to generate “guesses” that it can apply automatically if it is confident about them, or ask users for a validation.</p>

<h3>&rarr; Machine Learning</h3>

<p><b>Key point:</b> while the Open Food Facts data is a very interesting base to conduct research projects, our key goal is not only to research and train models, but to actually deploy working high precision models that make a difference. A good strategy could be to address first a subset of a problem with a solution that can be easily extended over time.</p>

<h3>&rarr; Open Food Facts database and backend</h3>

<p>At the heart of Open Food Facts, we store all the product data in a MongoDB database and use a Perl backend for our website and our read and write API, used by more than 100 applications. The server also does a lot of analysis to extract and structure data from multilingual ingredients lists and to compute new insights such as the processing degree of food products and their impact on the environment.</p>

<p><b>Our challenges:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure and code quality
<p>The server has grown a lot organically during the last 8 years, and we have a lot of progress to make to automate deployment, improve architecture, performance, code quality, tests and documentation, and to make contributing more accessible and welcoming for new developers. We could for instance try to reduce our dependence on Perl by splitting some functionality that could be developed in languages with bigger and growing developer communities.</p>

<p><b>Key point:</b> Open Food Facts does complex things and is continuously evolving. Finding the right way to do things is only the beginning, we also need to find incremental ways to get there.</p>
</li>

<li>New power user interface on the Open Food Facts website
<p>Many of our most dedicated contributors use the Open Food Facts website to review and edit thousand of products. Powerful search and edit features such as adding a specific information to all products matching a specific criteria can save them thousands of hours.</p>

<h3>&rarr; Food Knowledge Graph (Folksonomy Engine)</h3>

<p>Making choices regarding food often depends on the food category considered. Some criteria are especially important when choosing a fish or a ready made meal. Showing and explaining those criteria in context (and whether the product meets them) when scanning a product would be very useful.</p>

<p>The Food Knowledge graph would be a system to augment product data, based on a taxonomy of knowledge. This could either be implemented within the core of Open Food Facts, or as a separate service in a popular language of your choice (eg: Python, NodeJS…)</p>

<p><b>Our challenge:</b></p>

<p>The Food Knowledge Graph is a new project, everything will need to be done: research use cases, define functional specs, establish technical specs, choose a database and a programming language, develop it, run it, document it, create an API etc.</p>

<h3>&rarr; Open Lists</h3>

<p>There are many things that can be done with food products data besides decrypting labels and comparing products. For instance you can track how much food you eat (and how healthy or environmentally friendly it is), keep an inventory of the food you have at home or in a small store, manage a private or shared shopping list, create virtual collections of products that share some specific traits etc. Many of those things could be done with an “open lists” system that would allow people to create and manage lists of products that could be private or public, individual or shared, with an history of edits and transactions, with optional tags and an optional amount of products. Think of it as a Google Drive for food products lists!</p>

<p><b>Our challenge:</b></p>

<p>Open Lists is a new project, everything will need to be done: research use cases, define functional specs, establish technical specs, choose a database and a programming language, develop it, run it, document it, create an API etc.</p>
