<h1>Eco-Score: the environmental impact of food products</h1>

<p><i>The Eco-Score is an environmental score (ecoscore) from A to E which makes it easy to compare the impact of food products on the environment.</i></p>

<h2>Why an environmental score?</h2>

<p>More and more consumers are concerned about <b>the impact of their food not only on their health, but also on the health of our planet.</b> Thanks to the Nutri-Score, it is now very easy to take into account the nutritional quality of products when purchasing, but it is very difficult if not impossible to compare their environmental footprint.</p>
<p>It is urgent to provide consumers with clear information about this environmental footprint, so that they can easily and quickly compare it for several products. This is what the Eco-Score environmental grade allows.</p>

<div class="panel callout">
<h3> The Eco-Score, a tool for more sustainable food </h3>
<p> The Eco-Score helps consumers who wish to move towards a more sustainable diet, by encouraging them to: </p>
<ul>
<li> Eat less meat but of better quality</li>
<li> Consume more organic products and products with quality labels </li>
<li> Favor local and seasonal products, with little packaging </li>
<li> Limit products containing problematic ingredients (endangered fish, unsustainable palm oil) </li>
</ul>

</div>

<br>

<h2>What is the Eco-Score?</h2>

<p>The Eco-Score is designed on a model similar to the Nutri-Score:
it is a grade from A to E which summarizes 15 environmental impacts.
The Eco-Score score is materialized by a colored leaf-shaped logo with a letter from A (very low impact) to E (very high impact).</p>

<img src="https://static.openfoodfacts.org/images/misc/ecoscore-impact-environnemental.png" alt="Ecoscore">

<p>The Eco-Score is supported by a consortium of many actors committed to better nutrition.</p>

<br><br>

<h2>How is the Eco-Score computed?</h2>

<h3>The benchmark score: life cycle analysis (LCA) with data from the Agribalyse database</h3>

<p>For each product category, a benchmark score is established using data from the Agribalyse environmental database designed by ADEME and INRAE.
These data correspond to the life cycle analysis (LCA) of the products.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment">Life cycle analysis</a>is a standardized assessment method for carrying out a multi-stage environmental assessment and multi-criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>6 production steps: agriculture, processing, packaging, transportation, distribution and consumption</li>
<li>14 environmental impact indicators: climate change/carbon footprint, ozone layer depletion, ionizing radiation, land, water, and energy use; pollution of air and marine and fresh water (particles, acidification, eutrophication); and depletion of resources.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bonuses and penalties to refine the grading of each product</h3>

<p>In order to take into account certain impacts on the environment which are not covered well by the life cycle analysis (such as biodiversity) and the specificities of each product within the same category, the score of reference is modulated with bonuses and penalties:</p>

<h3>An increased need for transparency to better measure and reduce environmental impacts</h3>
<p>To accurately calculate the Eco-Score, it is necessary to have information which is not necessarily specified on the packaging (such as the origin and the exact percentage of each ingredient) or which is rarely available in usable form (such as a list of all the components of the packaging with the precise types of plastics used).</p>
<p>Average values are used when this information is not yet available, but we are now calling on everyone to help us collect this information which will be very useful for the Eco-Score but also for many other uses.</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturers can send us their information directly through our <a href="https://world.pro.openfoodfacts.org">free platform for producers.</a></li>
<li>All citizens can help us gather and structure the information that is present on products or that can be deduced from them, such as information on packaging: <a href="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/mission-emballages-un-grand-recensement-collaboratif-des-emballages-de-tous-les-produits-alimentaires">Mission Emballages: a large-scale collaborative inventory of packaging for all food products (in French)

<h2>How to see the Eco-Score for food products?</h2>

<h3>Scan products with the Open Food Facts app</h3>

<p><a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app">The Open Food Facts app</a> allows you to quickly get the Eco-Score of products: all you have to do is scan their barcode. If you have already installed the Open Food Facts app, please update it to get the new version!</p>

<img src="https://static.openfoodfacts.org/images/ecoscore/ecoscore_iphone_lasagne.png" alt="The Eco-Score on the Open Food Facts app" style="max-height: 400px">

<p>The Eco-Score is or will soon be available in the apps of other actions who built the Eco-Score. And Open Food Facts is a Wikipedia of foods that anyone can reuse freely and for free. The more than 100 applications that use the Open Food Facts database will also be able to display the Eco-Score that we calculate.</p>

<h3>Compare the Eco-Score of products on the Open Food Facts site</h3>

<p><a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">The Open Food Facts website</a> allows everyone to see and compare the ecoscore of more than 750,000 food products sold in France. The results of each search show the nutritional quality with the Nutri-Score, ultra-processed foods with NOVA, and the environmental impact with the Eco-Score.</p>

<h2>How the Eco-Score can encourage the improvement of products and the reduction of their environmental impacts</h2>

<p>The Eco-Score has two levers of action:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Eco-Score allows a more informed choice of consumers who can now easily take into account the environmental impact of products as a criterion of choice.</li>
<li>The Eco-Score encourages manufacturers to improve their products so that they achieve a higher Eco-Score rating.</li>
</ul>

<p>This second lever is very important because it allows an overall improvement of the offer and thus reaches all consumers.</p>

<p>The energy rating of household appliances has thus profoundly transformed the offer (try to find a fridge rated E, or even D or C!). And the democratization of Nutri-Score has also encouraged many manufacturers to improve the nutritional quality of their products to obtain a better rating (to the point that some French manufacturers even brag about it on bus stops, such as Brossard for its Savane cake).</p>

<p>To encourage product improvements, our <a href="https://world.pro.openfoodfacts.org">platform for producers</a> automatically analyzes data provided by manufacturers to identify avenues for improvement. The platform thus identifies all the products that would obtain a better Nutri-Score score with a slight change in composition (a reduction in salt of 5% for example).</p>
<p>Soon, the platform will make it possible to suggest ways to reduce the ecological impact and obtain a better Eco-Score (for example by using a more recyclable plastic for packaging, or by replacing palm oil with another oil).</p>

<br><br>

<h2>How can we find out more and how can we help us develop the Eco-Score?</h2>

<p>Everyone is welcome to help us create more transparency, educate consumers, and encourage product improvement through Eco-Score.</p>

<div class="panel">
<p>The Eco-Score is still young and can certainly be improved.
Given the climate and environmental emergency, however, it seems important to us to make it available now.</p>
<p>By working together, we will be able to gradually improve the Eco-Score, refine its formula, and gather the data necessary for its computation.</p>
<p>Your feedback, observations and suggestions will therefore be very valuable.</p>
