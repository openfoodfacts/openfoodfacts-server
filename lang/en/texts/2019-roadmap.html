<h1>Open Food Facts 2019 Roadmap</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This draft roadmap shows priorities for the Open Food Facts project and what we could do in 2019. Many of those projects depend not only on volunteers and contributors, but also on putting in place a small permanent team of people to develop infrastructure and tools and to manage projects from end to end. This roadmap is the base for estimating or funding needs for 2019 and beyond and for presenting to potential funders what we could do with their help.</p>
<p>To discuss this roadmap, you can&#160;<a data-cke-saved-href="https://slack.openfoodfacts.org/" href="https://slack.openfoodfacts.org/">join us on Slack</a>&#160;in the #roadmap channel), or e-mail us at contact@openfoodfacts.org</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Infrastructure +&#160;Data +&#160;People +&#160;Projects = Impact</p>
<p>Our goal is to maximise the impact of Open Food Facts. This impact results of the combination of Infrastructure, Data, People and Projects, and our roadmap is thus architectured around those 5 priorities:</p>
<p>1. Design and build infrastructure (database, web site, API) to continue to multiply the number of products and users every year</p>
<p>2. Improve data quality, freshness, quantity and depth</p>
<p>3. Grow the number of users, contributors, producers, developers, translators and re-users and empower them</p>
<p>4. Launch projects to multiply the impact of OFF</p>
<p>5. Find sustainable funding, improve the structure of the association and put in place a small permanent team</p>
<toc>
<h2>1. Design and build infrastructure (database, web site, API) to continue to multiply the number of products and users every year</h2>
<h3>1.1 Support a doubling number of products every year</h3>
<p>The number of products is going from 400K to 800K in 2018, we need to put in place an hardware and software infrastructure that can support that growth. A particular concern is the disk space currently needed for the product pictures.</p>
<p>Benefits: continuing database growth</p>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 backend developper for 3 months, + hardware ressources</p>
<h3>1.2 Support 5X users of OFF (web site, apps, API)</h3>
<p>Improve the performance of the database, web site and API so that we can serve more users on our web site and mobile apps, and support more re-uses. We are currently near capacity (the site and apps can be unavailable or degraded when we get big spikes of users when OFF is presented on TV)</p>
<p>Benefits : continuing user growth, no downtime when OFF goes on TV (and thus more users)</p>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 backend developper for 3 months</p>
<h3>1.3 Maintenance</h3>
<p>Keep all the services running, monitoring, small fixes, install software updates etc.</p>
<p>Recurring ressources per year: 0.25 backend engineer + 0.25 mobile engineer&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>2. Improve data quality, freshness, quantity and depth</h2>
<h3>2.1. Multiply&#160;the number of direct data imports from producers</h3>
<p>We have implemented direct data imports from 3 producers, but many more have volunteered data and pictures for their products. We need to industrialize the imports and then to proactively contact producers to ask for data.</p>
<p>Benefits: data that is complete (all products from one producer), up to date and error-free;&#160;</p>
<p>2019 ressources: 1&#160;backend developper + 1&#160;project manager for 3 months</p>
<h3>2.2 Use artificial intelligence (computer vision / machine learning) to infer data from product pictures</h3>
<p>We have built working prototypes to automatically extract data from product pictures (ingredients, nutrition facts, labels logos etc.). We need to increase the accuracy of those algorithms and industrialize them so that we can deploy them on OFF to automatically extract and/or check data in the OFF database.&#160;</p>
<p>Benefits: more products with complete data, more accurate data, easier and faster entry of new products</p>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 data scientist for 12 months, 1&#160;backend developper for 3 months</p>
<h3>2.3 Multiply the number of apps that allow users to contribute to Open Food Facts</h3>
<p>More than 100 apps use the OFF database, but only a few allow their users to send photos and data for products that are not yet in the database. We've had thematic and geographic opportunities that haven't fully materialized yet because of the complexity of the contribution API.</p>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 ios  + 1 android developer + 1 project manager for 2 months</p>
<p>2.3.1 Create contribution SDKs to make it easy to integrate Open Food Facts contribution in Android and iOS apps</p>
<p>Having a SDK reduces integration time in 3rd party apps, and enables us to ensure contribution is consistant and done the right way, with apps quickly adopting the latest API improvements.</p>
<h3>2.4. Create more multilingual taxonomies to make the data more useful</h3>
<p>We have created multilingual hierarchies (taxonomies) to make product data more structured and more useful. For instance we have a taxonomy of categories so that we can easily compare products from a specific category, at different levels (e.g. strawberry yogurts, and yogurts). We need to create more of them to allow more uses of the data.</p>
<p>Ressources: volunteers</p>
<h4>2.4.1 Create a multilingual taxonomy for ingredients</h4>
<p>We started to build an ingredients taxonomy in 2018, which is used in particular to compute the NOVA score. A more dense and detailed taxonomy will enable more interesting uses such as determining automatically if a product is suitable for vegetarians or for vegans, to automatically translate ingredients lists etc.</p>
<h4>2.4.2 Create taxonomies for packaging</h4>
<p>Distinguish fresh / frozen / canned products, the package shape and materials, recycling instructions etc.</p>
<h4>2.4.3. Create taxonomies for brands and brands owners</h4>
<p>Useful for apps that want to highlight the environmental or social impact of the companies that make the products.</p>
<h2>3. Grow the number of users, contributors, producers, developers, translators and re-users and empower them</h2>
<h3>3.1 Improve the OFF mobile apps</h3>
<p>The OFF Android and iOS apps have 2 main purposes: to inform users food choices and educate them through a factual, scientific and educational approach; and to allow users to contribute product pictures and data. They are often the first point of contact for users who discover OFF, and in addition to the direct impact they provide, they are also a good vector to turn users into contributors and participants to the project.</p>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 iOS developper + 1 Android developper for 12&#160;months.</p>
<h4>3.1.1 Bring the iOS app to the level of the Android app</h4>
<p>We deployed a completely new version of the Android app in 2018 with a much improved experience for users and contributors. The iOS app has not evolved since 2013 and is using outdated technology, we need to create and deploy a new version with continuous scanning and features to contribute photos and data for new products more easily.</p>
<h4>3.1.2 Create more value for users in the Android and iOS apps</h4>
<p>The OFF app was originally designed more for contributing than for decrypting. New app users are now more interested at first in the immediate value they get from the app. We need to add features to give them more value (improved user experience, sorting products by user preferences, product exploration etc.) so that they become loyal app users, and then hint that they can contribute too.</p>
<p>3.1.3 Start unifying the Open Food Facts and Open X Facts apps in one single app</p>
<p>We will have a hard time maintaining and convincing people to install 4 apps on their phones. We should let people contribute cosmetics, pet food and other products from the Open Food Facts apps and route them to the right project. We should also display products from the right project directly in the app.</p>
<h3>3.2 Improve the contribution experience</h3>
<p>People who contribute new product photos and data are vital to OFF.</p>
<p>Ressources: 1 backend developer + 1&#160;data scientist for 3 months</p>
<h4>3.2.1. Improve the experience for first-time contributors</h4>
<p>e.g. suggest easy way to start contributing, for instance by asking for small pieces of data directly in the product display page instead of through a complete but intimidating product edit form (micro-contributions).</p>
<h4>3.2.2. Automate tedious tasks as much as possible</h4>
<p>e.g. use artificial intelligence algorithms to make suggestions (e.g. for product categories), to automaticall rotate and pre-crop images</p>
<h4>3.2.3 Build tools to empower contributors</h4>
<p>e.g. mass import of product pictures</p>
<p>3.2.3 Build more powerful moderation tools</p>
<p>Enable switching the language of a product's field and images, wiping nutritional values , reverting a product to a previous revision, reporting a problematic user id (and the issue type), all in 1-click.</p>
<h3>3.3. Increase external communication</h3>
<p>Recurring ressources: 0.5 person per year + volunteers&#160;</p>
<p>We have been so far much better at doing things than to talk about things we have done. It is important that we increase the level of external communication so that the project becomes more visible, to attract new users and contributors, and to boost the enthusiasm of our existing users, contributors and supporters.</p>
<p>3.3.1 Scale visual communication accross languages</p>
<p>Local products, slogans that work with the local culture.&#160;Images are complicated to translate and localize, but they are worth a thousand words. We need to create a simple translation pipeline for them.</p>
<p>3.3.2 Scale&#160;communication accross languages</p>
<p>Communication should be international ready from the start. Ensure we can communicate in all major languages within 48 hours of prepping a message in English.</p>
<p>3.3.3 Ensure all public are funneled to the right information</p>
<p>We need to do a better job at funnelling developpers, 3rd party reusers, journalists, food producers, academia, nutrition students, government… like we do for regular users. Tell them what Open Food Facts can bring them, and what they&#160;can do for Open Food Facts.</p>
<h4>3.3.4. Create a better press kit for journalists</h4>
<p>With key facts and numbers, quotes, photos, visuals etc.</p>
<p>Also suggest story angles: e.g. the work of contributors.</p>
<h4>3.3.5 Create a presentation kit for participants</h4>
<p>So that everyone can present the project, in any language. Include presentations, ready-to-print and printed posters, stickers etc.</p>
<h4>3.3.6 Create an educational kit for schools, colleges, universities</h4>
<p>e.g. ideas of activities that can be done with students using OFF data, for different levels and subjects (e.g. biology / nutrition, geography, computer science etc.)</p>
<h4>3.3.7 Create a small video or animation to present Open Food Facts</h4>
<p>Something that can be shared on social media. It should be inspiring, extendable, have a distinct Open Food Facts feel (eg. not one of those toon auto-generated videos), it should&#160;not be patronizing, it should cross languages and culture. It should also have clear calls to actions and measurable impact.</p>
<h3>3.4. Improve community management</h3>
<p>Recurring ressources: 0.5 person per year + volunteers&#160;</p>
<p>3.4.1 Increase internal communication</p>
<p>We need a weekly status report of what's going on in Open Food Facts, as well as requests for help. This should be available by email dispatch, social media, in a special section of the apps, as well as on Slack.</p>
<p>3.4.2 Install a system to improve response time for emails and support requests</p>
<p>It is very time consuming to reply in a timely maneer to all the emails and messages on social networks that we receive every day, and we are losing potential users, contributors, reusers etc. We can install a request tracking system to allow more people to reply and to make sure that we follow through on every request.</p>
<h3>3.5. Improve experience for open source developers and re-users</h3>
<p>2019 ressources: 1&#160;backend developer for 6 months, 1 data scientist + 1 mobile developer for 3 months</p>
<p>3.5.1. Redesign, implement and document the API</p>
<p>A well documented API is vital, especially for the contribution part. We need to document the currrent API with modern tools like Swagger so that its usage is simplified, and it's discoverable through tools like API explorers, thus increasing reuses.</p>
<p>3.5.2. Make the backend of OFF easier to install and better documented</p>
<p>The backend (database, web server and API) part of OFF is a complex system to install. It makes contributing to it very difficult as developers need several hours to set up a working environment. We can use tools such as Docker to simplify this.</p>
<p>3.5.3 Build a AI deployment pipeline that ensure speedy deployment and testing of AI models</p>
<p>The proverb says AI is 80% about creating a clean data pipeline to feed the model. We are lucky to already have relatively clean data, but we're slower in deploying to production. We need to put a sandboxed framework to enable easier deployment of models for testing, We need to assess results in a repeatable way using golden sets, We need a way to dry-running them on the entire database, integrate high confidence results automatically, and dispatch low confidence results to contributors for review.</p>
<p>3.5.4 Automate the Android and iOS testing pipelines</p>
<p>Creating localized screenshots, pushing app listings and new builds is very important yet time consuming. It should be automated to ensure we can experiment more freely.</p>
<h3>3.6. Build a self-service platform to empower producers</h3>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 backend developer for 9 months</p>
<p>Maintenance: 0.25 backend&#160;developer + 0.25&#160;project manager</p>
<p>Build and deploy a self-service platform for producers so that they can easily add and manage their products, get the Nutri-Score, generate reports and exports, and get suggestions to improve their products (e.g. product XYZ has 40% more salt that the average in its category).</p>
<h3>3.7 Re-structure the translation pipeline</h3>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 backend developer for 3 months</p>
<p>We currently use Crowdin so that people from all over the world can translate the Open Food Facts web site and mobile apps in all languages. But everything that need translation is not in Crowdin and there is still a lot of manual work to check and deploy translations.</p>
<p>Make everything easily translatable, and easy and quick to deploy without any risk of breaking something.</p>
<h3>3.7.2 Re-structure the taxonomy pipeline</h3>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 backend developer for 3 months</p>
<p>The taxonomies (e.g. categories, labels, ingredients) are currently managed using a wiki, a pad, and github. It is hard to extend them and translate them, and some of them are becoming huge. We need to build a new system to make it easier to manage, enrich and translate taxonomies.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h2>4. Launch projects to multiply the impact of OFF</h2>
<h3>4.1. International development in selected countries</h3>
<p>The long term goal of OFF is to build a database of all products in the world. In the short term, we can also a pragmatic approach and take advantage of opportunities to reach the critical mass of products, users and re-users in a few countries.</p>
<p>2019 ressources: TBD - (e.g. person for 3 months per country)</p>
<h4>4.1.2. OFF in Belgium, Switzerland, Germany</h4>
<p>A few European countries are showing interest in adopting the Nutri-Score grade, which we compute on OFF.</p>
<h3>4.2. Intensify partnerships with researchers who use OFF</h3>
<p>Teams such as EREN in France (Nutri-Score, additives etc.) use the OFF database for their studies on nutrition and public health. We can work with them not only to gather data, but also to find way to match it to their needs (e.g. matching OFF with data from cohorts). Collaborations with scientific teams are a very important way to broaden the impact of OFF to everyone (with benefits to the general populations and not just OFF users or users of OFF re-uses). It is also very motivating to all OFF participants.</p>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 backend developer for 3 months</p>
<h3>4.3. Open Beauty Facts</h3>
<p>A first version of the V2 Android app is almost ready - it is still missing the harmful ingredient detection. We need to make it easier to understand the role and impact of each ingredient, give a sense of how problematic they are based on sound science, and give people a way to ban ingredients they are sensitive to.</p>
<p>The iOS app has the ingredient detection live, and could be updated over the air, but very much like the Open Food Facts app, it needs a fresh interface, and possibly merging with Open Food Facts.</p>
<p>2019 ressources: 1 backend developer for 6 months, 1&#160;cosmetics / biology expert for 3 months</p>
<h3>4.4. Open Products Facts</h3>
<p>Open Products Facts poses the challenge of having many data models for many types of products. We should source and&#160;integrate those data models, adding support for on the fly switching of data models.</p>
<p>Eventually, we should start considering Open Products Facts as the umbrella project for all products in the world, with Open Food Facts and Open Beauty Facts becoming mere "flavors" of it, specialized in food and cosmetics.</p>
<p>2019 ressources: TBD, can be incremental</p>
<h3>4.5. Estimate the environmental impact of products and educate users</h3>
<p>We have started a project with the Data for Good team to try to evaluate the carbon impact of products based on their ingredients, packaging, place of manufacturing etc. While it may be hard to derive a precise ecological impact for carbon, water, land use etc. we can try to surface interesting data to educate users about the products they scan.</p>
<p>2019 ressources: Data for Good and OFF volunteers, 1 backend developper for 12 months</p>
<h3>4.6. Gather actionable scientific data on food additives and controversed ingredients</h3>
<p>It is very difficult to know with certainty the danger of many food additives and ingredients. We have started a project to gather scientific data about additives and to surface this data in a way that users can take action on. For instance we use EFSA data to evaluate the risk of overexposure to certain additives to some population groups (e.g. children). We can then show the range of products that contain this additive so that people can get a better idea of whether they are at risk of overexposure or not.</p>
<p>2019 ressources: Volunteers, 1 backend developper for 3 months</p>
<h2>5. Find sustainable funding, improve the structure of the association and put in place a small permanent team</h2>
<p>To execute the roadmap, in addition to the continued involvement of volunteers and contributors, we need to put in place a small permanent team to build and develop the necessary infrastructure and tools and to drive the projects from start to finish.</p>
<h3>5.1. Find sustainable funding</h3>
<p>OFF operates under the following principles:<br />
- We are a non profit and we will stay a non profit<br />
- We need to be independent of the food industry<br />
- We do not sell anything, our database is open data and all our services are free in order to maximize our impact</p>
<p>Therefore the available sources of funding are mostly individual donations, public funding / subventions, and funding from private foundations that are not linked to the food industry.</p>
<p>In order to be able to plan our development and work in a serene way, we need to find diverse sources of funding and encourage recurrent donations and multi-year subventions over one time donations and calls for projects.</p>
<p>Recurring ressources: 0.5 person per year</p>
<h3>5.2. Improve the structure of the association</h3>
<p>Historically, members of the board of the OFF association have been some of the most active members of the OFF community. It would be a good thing to have a larger board, with also people who are not involved in OFF's day to day activities, but who have relevant experiences at other similar organizations, and who can focus more on the long term view.</p>
<p>Putting in place a small permanent team brings new challenges: an important one is to secure funding, but a very important one as well is to make sure that the volunteers, the permanent team and all the participants to the project work well together to achieve the project goals.</p>
<p>Ressources: volunteers</p>
<h3>5.3. Put in place a small permanent team</h3>
<p>Once we start to find some sustainable funding, we can start recruiting the people we need to accomplish the roadmap.</p>
<p>Recurring ressources: 1 team leader / project manager per year</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
