<h3>How does this game work?</h3>

<p>The game randomly loads a product from Open Food Facts that needs to be completed. The interface is simple, allowing you to interact by answering a question about an attribute of the product by "Yes, Skip or No" and get more product information if needed.</p>

<p>The interface is divided into 3 parts:</p>
<div><img style="max-height:400px" src="/images/misc/hunger-game-0.png"></div><br>

<h3 style="background-color:#00d400;padding:1%;color:#fff;font-weight:bold;">1. The question</h3>
<p>To answer the question, just click on one of the 3 options (Yes/No/Skip) and the game will automatically move onto the next product.</p>

<p>At the top of the screen are 4 buttons (filters) allowing you to select the type of questions you wish to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>label</strong>: Questions relating to the "label" field (eg. certification, product origin, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>category</strong>: Questions relating to the "category" field (eg drinks, sweets, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>brand</strong>: Questions relating to the brand of the product (eg Sod√©bo, Charal, Alter Eco, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>product_weight</strong>: Questions relating to the weight of the product (eg 100 g, 1L, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Below we find:</p>
<ol>
<li>A search field, allowing you to specify which brand, label, category you want to work on,</li>
<li>The question to be answered in English. In English, this gives: "Does this product correspond to the indicated value?"</li>
<li>Product image,</li>
<li>3 clickable buttons to answer the question.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>When you are not 100% sure of your answer you must answer "Skip"!</strong>Above all, do not answer "Yes" or "No" if you are not sure of your choice.
Another person will take care of qualifying this data later! This game is above all collaborative and aims to contribute efficiently and qualitatively to Open Food Facts data.</p>

<h3 style="background-color:#00d400;padding:1%;color:#fff;font-weight:bold;">2. Access information</h3>
<p>If the answer is not visible on the product image, this part of the screen allows you to view the product information. You can click on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product photos you can zoom on,</li>
<li>The "View" button: provides access to the product page on the Web version of Open Food Facts,</li>
<li>The "Edit" button: lets you edit the product on Open Food Facts,.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last option is useful when the product requires further modification.</p>
<h3 style="background-color:#00d400;padding:1%;color:#fff;font-weight:bold;">3. Annotations</h3>
<p>On the far right of the screen (or at the very bottom of the screen if you are on mobile), there are annotations that let you know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of products remaining to be treated (varies depending on the filters applied),</li>
<li>The number of annotated products,</li>
<li>A history of the latest actions taken during your session.</li>
</ul>
