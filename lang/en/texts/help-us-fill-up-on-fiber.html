<h1>Help us fill up on fiber</h1>

<h2>The mission</h2>

<p>The mission consists in adding the content value for fiber to the Open Food Facts product sheets in order to be able to compute the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore">Nutri-Score</a>.</p>
<p>We have designed algorithms which make it possible to identify the products for which we have received a photo which contains a nutritional table with a line for fibers, but for which the value for fibers has not been entered in our database.</p>
<p>It is necessary to edit the files of these products to select the new photo of the nutritional table (if necessary), and enter the missing value for the fibers.</p>

<h2>Why this is important</h2>

This will allow this fiber value to be taken into account instantly for the computation of the Nutri-Score on <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/">the Open Food Facts site</a> and <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app">the Open Food Facts app</a>.
