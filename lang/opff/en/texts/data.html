<p>Please read <a href="https://world.openpetfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use">Terms and conditions of use and re-use</a> before re-using the data.</p> 


<p>We are very interested in learning what the Open Pet Food Facts data is used for. It is not mandatory, but we would very much appreciate it if you <a href="mailto:contact@openfoodfacts.org">tell us about your re-uses</a> so that we can share them
with the Open Pet Food Facts community.</p>

<h2>Open Pet Food Facts data exports</h2>

<p>Database dumps and exports are generated nightly.</p>

<p>Information on the different fields for the MongoDB dump and CSV exports is available at <a href="https://static.openpetfoodfacts.org/data/data-fields.txt">https://world.openpetfoodfacts.org/data/data-fields.txt</a></p>


<h3>MongoDB dump</h3>

<p>Data for all products is available in a MongoDB database dump.</p>

<h4>Delta Export</h4>

<p>Daily delta exports are provided for the previous 14 days. The list of currently available delta files can be found at
 <a href="https://static.openpetfoodfacts.org/data/delta/index.txt">https://static.openpetfoodfacts.org/data/delta/index.txt</a>.
 Each line represents a file that is available at <code>https://static.openpetfoodfacts.org/data/delta/{filename}</code>.
 The filename contains UNIX timestamp of the first and the last change contained in the JSON file, so that the delta files can
 be imported (after extraction) with <code>mongoimport</code> in alphabetical order.</p>
<p>Please note that due to the nature of <code>mongoexport</code>, the delta files cannot tell you about deleted products. To remove
 deleted products from your database, you will need to import the full MongoDB dump.</p>
 
<h3>CSV Data Export</h3>

<p>Data for all products, or some of the products, can be downloaded in CSV format (readable with OpenOffice, Excel and many other software)
 through the <a href="https://world.openpetfoodfacts.org/cgi/search.pl">advanced search form</a>.</p>

</dl>

<p>The file encoding is Unicode UTF-8. The character that separates fields is &lt;tab&gt; (tabulation).</p>



<h3>RDF Data Export</h3>

<p>The database is also available in the RDF format. <a href="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/des-donnees-libres-et-liees-export-rdf-des-donnees">announcement in French</a>.</p>

</dl>

<h2>Live JSON API</h2>

<p>A JSON API is also available to read the data for a product. This API is in particular used in the Open Pet Food Facts mobile app for iPhone and Android.</p>

<p>We change the API over-time but we are careful to keep backwards compatibility. Please tell us if you use it, so that we can tell you about potential changes.</p>

<p>URL to read data for a product: https://world.openpetfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/<i>[barcode]</i>.json</p>

<p>Example: <a href="https://world.openpetfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/3600550578041.json">https://world.openpetfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/3600550578041.json</a></p>

Further documentation is <a href="https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/API">available on the Wiki</a>. (Important note: the page is divided into subpages for READ and WRITE). 
A better documentation is being developped, with uses cases for displaying a product, and letting your users add the data required to get the Nutri-Score, NOVA groups and additives.
<a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8470508/SVtN3Wzy?version=latest#intro">You can access it here</a>.
<p>You are very welcome to use the API for production cases, as long as 1 API call = 1 real scan by a user.
Any attempt to scrape the database using the API will very likely be blocked, as full daily exports are available on this very page.</p>
<p>Also, sending an HTTP header with your API call is a good way we can get in touch, should any issue arise.</p>
<p>If you are unsure about anything, or have any question (there is no silly question), feel free to ask it on Slack :-)</p>

<h2>Android and iPhone mobile app (help needed!)</h2>

<p>The code for the Open Pet Food Facts mobile app is available on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-androidapp">Android</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ios">iOS</a>). <b>We need help to adapt the new native iOS code to cosmetics</b>
The app allows users to scan the barcode of products, to view the product information, and to take and send pictures and data for missing products.</p>

<p>The app for iOS is developed in Swift.</p>
<p>The app for Android is developed in Java.</p>
<p>You are welcome to reuse the code (it's open source) and help us improve it, for everyone, on all the planet.

<h2>Wrappers and SDKs</h2>
<p>We probably have a wrapper for your favorite programming language. If we do, you can use it and improve it, and probably add Open Pet Food Facts support to it. If we don't, you can help create it.</p>
<p>They will let you consume data, as well as let your users contribute new data</p>
