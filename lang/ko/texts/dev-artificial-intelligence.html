		<h3>카테고리 예측 네트워크</h3>
		<p>We try to predict food categories based on the various data we already have on the product. We use several complementary and pragmatic approaches, including NLP, Regex and Data-Vectors

		<h3>The Robotoff collaborative annotation platform</h3>
		<p>While Open Food Facts itself is a large collaborative annotation platform, our latest effort, Robotoff, takes this a step further to turn images into actionable insights than can be applied by a machine or human decision.

		<h3>Robotoff</h3>
		<p>
		Robotoff can analyze photos, and depending on whether it's sure or unsure about a fact, he can edit Open Food Facts on its own, or ask blue questions to a human to validate.

		<h3>What technologies ?</h3>
		<p>
		We have a very pragmatic approach to AI. The same problem can be solved by various techniques, depending on the data we already have for a specific product. Also, sometimes classic techniques like REGEX achieve the same result as sophisticated networks. So whether you're into NLP, CNN, Vision or anything else, there's likely an impact you can have.
