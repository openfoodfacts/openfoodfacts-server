<p id="description"> <a href=" https://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a> - 무료 개방 식품 데이터베이스 <a href="https://openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a>는 가능한 한 다양한 국가의 식품 데이터를 공개하는 작업인 <b>Open Food Hunt</b>를 시작하고 있습니다.</p>

<p>15.000 명의 기여자가 Open Food Facts에 660.000 개의 제품을 추가했습니다. 
이 데이터베이스에는 <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/countries">100개 이상의 서로 다른 국가</a>의 제품들이 포함되어 있습니다. 하지만 그 대부분은 2012년에 Open Food Factions가 출시된 프랑스와 스페인, 영국, 미국, 벨기에와 같은 몇몇 국가에서 사용되고 있습니다. 이 나라들에는 매우 의욕적인 기여자들이 있습니다.
Open Food Hunt는 다음과 같은 변화를 목표로 합니다 : 150 개의 누락된 국가의 제품을 추가하고 가능한 많은 국가의 중요한 제품에 도달하려고 합니다.
더 중요한 것은 <b> Open Food Hunt의 활발한 기여자 커뮤니티를 만들고 개발하는 것입니다.</b> </p>

<h3>Open Data Day</h3>

<blockquote style="font-style:italic">"Open Data Day는 전 세계 도시의 시민들이 모여 애플리케이션을 작성하고, 데이터를 자유화하고, 시각화 하고, 개방형 공공 데이터를 사용하여 분석함으로써 전 세계 지방, 지역 및 국가 정부의 개방형 데이터 정책에 대한 지원 및 장려를 보여줍니다."
</blockquote>

<p>대부분의 공개 데이터는 정부 및 공공 기관에서 제공되지만, 매우 유용한 일부 데이터는 <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>을 만드는 데 사용되는 데이터와 마찬가지로 개인이 데이터를 수집하는 크라우드 소싱을 통해 수집됩니다.
Food products data in Open Food Facts is aso crowdsourced by contributors who use their smartphones to scan product barcodes and to take pictures of products, ingredients lists and nutrition facts.</p>

<p><b>Food is something every human being is interested in</b>, and open food data can be a very good introduction to open data, as it is useful to everyone (e.g. to decode labels, to compare products, to eat better, and to play !). We hope Open Food Facts and Open Food Hunt will be presented in many Open Data Day gatherings. If you are organizing an Open Data Day event in your city, we have some slides available online and we would be very happy to exchange with you, so please get in touch!</p>

<h3 style="clear:right">Open Food Explorers and Open Food Ambassadors</h3>

<p>Starting on Open Data Day and for one week, Open Food Facts contributors will become <b>Open Food Explorers</b>: their goal will be to add as many products from their country on Open Food Facts and to make it reach the next level: from no product to one product, from 1 to 10, 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 1000 to 10000... (and for people in France we have a special goal to go from 400.000 to 500.000!).</p>

<p>Existing and new contributors will also be invited to become <b>Open Food Ambassadors</b> who recruit new contributors, both in their country and outside their country. In particular ambassadors are highly encouraged to present Open Food Facts to their family and friends living in countries where we currently have no or few products.</p>

<h3>Open Food Hunt friendly competition</h3>

<p>From Saturday February 21st to Sunday March 1st, we will keep track of the top Open Food Explorers and Open Food Ambassadors.</p>

<p>Open Food Explorers will be awarded explorer points for each new product they add:</p>

<ul>    
<li>100 points for the 1st product added to a country (i.e. there are currently no products in Open Food Facts for that country)</li>
<li>20 points for each of the first 10 products added to a country</li>
<li>10 points for each of the first 100 products</li>
<li>5 points for each of the first 1000 products</li>
<li>2 points for each of the first 10000 products</li>
<li>1 points for each product after that</li>
</ul>

<p>Points are doubled when the product pages are complete: with pictures for ingredients and nutrition facts and all data entered.</p>

<p><em>"Open your fridge!" suggests this magnet  :-)</em></p>

<p>Open Food Ambassadors will also receive ambassador points corresponding to the explorer points of all the new contributors they recruit.</p>

<p>All Open Food Explorers and Ambassadors will receive an Open Food Facts magnet and sticker and the top Explorers and Ambassadors will receive some small rewards (TBD).</p>

<p>We will also keep track of the total of points for each country.</p>
