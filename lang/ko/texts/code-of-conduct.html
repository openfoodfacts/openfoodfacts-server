<h1>운영 규정</h1>

<p>Open Food Facts는 자원 봉사자 커뮤니티가 주도하는 프로젝트입니다. 모두가 참여할 수 있도록 초대되고, 모든 사람이 항상 환영받는다고 느낄 수 있도록 당신이  다른 회원들과 친절하고 예의 바르게 교류하고 우리의 규칙을 따를 것을 부탁드립니다.</p>

<h2>규칙</h2>

<h3>차별 금지</h3>

<p>Open Food Facts는 연령, 성별, 성적 지향, 장애, 신체적 외관, 인종, 종교에 관계없이 모든 사람들에게 혐오받지 않는 환경을 제공하는 것에 최선을 다하고 있습니다..</p>

<h3>괴롭힘과 위협 금지</h3>

<p>우리는 어떤 형태로든 참가자들을 괴롭게 하거나 신변 안전을 위협하는 어떤 것도 용납하지 않습니다.</p>

<h3>개인 기여자에게 무례한 요구 금지</h3>

<p>모든 Open Food Facts 참가자 및 기여자는 프로젝트에 시간과 에너지를 쏟는 무급 자원봉사자들입니다. Please take this into account when you request something from an individual contributor,
and do accept answers like "No," "Not now," "Maybe," and/or "I don't know". Repeated and/or undue pressure to make a contributor do/answer something will be considered as harassment.</p>

<p>Requests that are likely to generate a significant amount of work should be sent to the administrators at contact@openfoodfacts.org and not to individual contributors.</p>


<h2>Consequences of not respecting the code of conduct</h2>

<p>People violating these rules may be temporary blocked or permanently banned from the project at the discretion of the administrators of the Open Food Facts Association.</p>

<p>In particular, bad actors who repeatedly ignore the rules and culture of the project, who are needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who are offensive, and who are unable to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so by others will be permanently banned from the project.</p>



<h2>Reporting abuse</h2>

<p>If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of conduct, please contact us at abuse@openfoodfacts.org to send us an abuse report. 
Please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.</p>

<p>Your report will be read, treated and answered by Stéphane Gigandet (President of the Open Food Facts Association) and Florentin Raud (initiator of this Code of conduct).</p>

<br/><br>

<p>Note: this code of conduct is inspired by the codes of conduct of other open communities like the <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>. Feel free to reuse it or part of it.</p>
