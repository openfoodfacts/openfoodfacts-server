    <h2>유용한 어플리케이션! 개인... 뿐만 아니라 모두에게!</h2>
    <p>2012 년 부터, <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app">Open Food Facts 앱은 </a> 식품을 스캔하고 레이블을 해독하는 데 사용되며, <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">최대 규모의 협업, 무료 및 개방형 식품 데이터베이스 구축에 참여하는 데도 사용됩니다.</a> The Open Food Facts app for Android and for the iPhone has evolved a lot in 2018 (<a href="https://en.blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/a-new-open-food-facts-mobile-app-to-better-decypher-labels-and-contribute-to-the-public-good">we're showing you all the new stuff here</a> and we invite you to <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/open-food-facts-mobile-app">try the new version</a> !), And we have plenty of other ideas for the app to be even more practical, more useful and therefore more used, to help even more people choose better quality foods, and to continue growing the Open Food Facts database!</p>
    <h2>What will the money collected be used for?</h2>
    <p>The development of the application is open source and largely provided by volunteer developers (a huge thank you to them!). The money collected will allow to hire a freelance developer to help finalize the application and develop some functions. Thanks to a grant from Public Health France and your donations on HelloAsso and <a href="https://www.lilo.org/en/open-food-facts/?utm_source=open-food-facts">Lilo</a> , we were able to hire a freelance developer for a few weeks which helped us enormously for the last version. This year, Public Health France renews its support, and thanks to your donations, we will again be able to accelerate the development of the application!</p>
