        <h2>Expert help needed</h2>
        <p>Developing Open Beauty Facts also requires specialized knowledge and expertise in many different areas:</p>
    </div>
</div>

<ul class="text-center small-block-grid-1 medium-block-grid-2 large-block-grid-3">
    <li>
        <h3>Quản lí dự án</h3>
        <p>We have tons of ideas and you probably have even more, but it is quite a challenge to prioritize them,
to build a roadmap, and to manage projects when every participant is a volunteer with often limited time available.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h3>Thiết kế</h3>
        <p>We need help to build a better user experience on the Open Beauty Facts web site and mobile app, to improve
their design, to create impactful presentation materials etc.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Phát triển</h3>
        <p>We have a lot of development work to do: on the Open Beauty Facts backend (Perl and MongoDB), API (JSON),
        web site (HTML5, JS, Foundation), iOS / Android / Windows Phone / FirefoxOS apps
(currently developed in HTML and JS with Apache Cordova / Phonegap), to build new cool reuses etc.
Our code is on <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openbeautyfacts">GitHub</a>.

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h3>Xây dựng cộng đồng</h3>
        <p>We need to build local communities in all countries and at the same time unite them globally.</p>
        <p>It is very difficult to bootstrap a local community in a country without living there, so your help
        to find the first very motivated participants is essential. Are you one of them?</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p>We are not sure what to write here, could you help?</p>
        <p>More seriously, there are lot of cool things that users, contributors and reusers do with Open Beauty Facts,
        it would be great to get more people to know about it. In particular we need help for public
        and <a href="/press">media relations</a>.</p>
        
    </li>   
    
    <li>
        <h3>Dựa án đặc biệt</h3>
        <p>There are lots of interesting and original applications of cosmetic open data that we could work on with
        government cosmetic agencies, cosmetic producers, researchers, universities, schools, NGOs etc. Maybe you already have ideas?
        If you do, please help us to push them forward.</p>
