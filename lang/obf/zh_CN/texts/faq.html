<h2 id="contact_the_team">How can I contact the Open Beauty Facts team, ask questions or make suggestions?</h2>

<p>You can ask questions or make suggestions on the <a href="https://openfoodfacts.uservoice.com/">Idea Forum</a> or contact us by e-mail: contact@openbeautyfacts.org</p>



<h2 id="data_verification">产品的信息和数据是否经过验证？</h2>

<p>The information and data is submited by the Open Beauty Facts contributors. The contributors also send pictures of the product, its labels, ingredients lists and health and beauty claims.
这样一来，游客在有疑问时，可以自行核对，如有错误，可以当场更正。 The contributors also send pictures of the product, its labels, ingredients lists and health and beauty claims.
When in doubt, visitors can thus check the accuracy by themselves, and if there is an error, they can correct it on the spot.</p>

<p>为了更容易发现潜在的错误，我们将逐步增加自动检查。 e.g. if the ingredients of a product are very different from
products of the same category, it may be an error.</p>


<h2 id="pictures_and_data_from_other_sites">我可以从厂家网站、购物网站或其他网站添加产品图片或数据吗？</h2>

<p>Almost all other sites forbid reproduction and reuse of their data and images, and that's actually the reason why we are creating Open Beauty Facts: to make all this data available to all and for all uses.</p>

<p>因此，为了避免法律问题，我们要求投稿者只添加自己拍摄的图片，只添加来自产品包装和标签的数据。</p>


<h2 id="adding_my_products">I am a cosmetics product manufacturer, can I add my own products?</h2>

<p>Yes! 是的! 唯一的条件是接受在公开许可下提供数据和图片。 (see the <a href="http://en.openbeautyfacts.org/terms-of-use#contribution">Terms of contribution</a>)</p>

<p>如果你有大量的产品需要添加（50个以上），我们可以尝试着想办法自动添加产品及其数据。 Contact-us to discuss how we could proceed: contact@openbeautyfacts.org</p>


<h2 id="difference_with_other_services">What is the difference with other web sites, services and mobile applications that already allow to view cosmetics products information?</h2>

<p>对我们来说，主要的区别是一个关键的区别：我们的数据是免费提供给所有的人和用途。 这就是所谓的开放数据。</p>

<p>几乎所有其他网站、服务和应用程序都禁止他人复制和再利用其数据。 Quite to the contrary, the jealously keep it for themselves. Quite to the contrary, the jealously keep it for themselves. In almost all cases,
their terms of service explicitly forbid any non-personal use and any extraction of all the data or parts of the data.</p>

<p>We consider that cosmetics products information is too important and useful to keep it locked in a safe. We consider that cosmetics products information is too important and useful to keep it locked in a safe. So we decided to do exactly the opposite: not only we allow use and reuse of our database, freely and without fee,
to everyone and for all uses (including commercial), but we also encourage it!</p>

<p>Making the data publicly available (what is know as <i>open data</i>) allows individuals, associations, companies, researchers etc. from all around the world to think up and develop applications for the data that
we certainly would never have thought about.</p>



<h2 id="economic_model">What is Open Beauty Facts' economic model</h2>

<p>投稿者为志愿者。 他们的贡献被收集在一个开放的数据库中，每个人都可以使用，并可用于各种用途。
(see the <a href="https://en.openbeautyfacts.org/terms-of-use#reuse">Terms of reuse</a>)</p>

<p>Everyone (including but not limited to Open Beauty Facts contributors and creator) can thus redistribute and/or reuse the data to build web sites, services, software, mobile applications, or to
write articles and studies. 只要尊重再利用的条件，他们可以自由提供所产生的作品，或出售或货币化(例如通过广告)。 They are free to make the resulting work freely available, or to sell or monetize it (e.g. with ads), as long as they respect the terms of reuse.</p>
