        <h2>전문가의 도움이 필요한 부분</h2>
        <p>Developing Open Beauty Facts also requires specialized knowledge and expertise in many different areas:</p>
    </div>
</div>

<ul class="text-center small-block-grid-1 medium-block-grid-2 large-block-grid-3">
    <li>
        <h3>프로젝트 관리</h3>
        <p>우리 모두 다양한 아이디어를 갖고 있겠지만, 프로젝트의 참여자 모두 시간에 제한이 있는 자원 봉사자들이기 때문에 많은 아이디어 중 우선순위를 정하여 로드맵을 세우고 프로젝트를 관리하는 것은 현실적으로 어려운 일입니다.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h3>디자인</h3>
        <p>We need help to build a better user experience on the Open Beauty Facts web site and mobile app, to improve
their design, to create impactful presentation materials etc.</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>개발</h3>
        <p>We have a lot of development work to do: on the Open Beauty Facts backend (Perl and MongoDB), API (JSON),
        web site (HTML5, JS, Foundation), iOS / Android / Windows Phone / FirefoxOS apps
(currently developed in HTML and JS with Apache Cordova / Phonegap), to build new cool reuses etc.
Our code is on <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openbeautyfacts">GitHub</a>.

    </li>
    
    <li>
        <h3>커뮤니티 구축</h3>
        <p>세계 각국에 로컬 커뮤니티를 구축하는 동시에 세계적으로 연합해야 합니다.</p>
        <p>It is very difficult to bootstrap a local community in a country without living there, so your help
        to find the first very motivated participants is essential. 이러한 사람들 중 한 명이 바로 여러분 아닌가요?</p>
    </li>

    <li>
        <h3>커뮤니케이션</h3>
        <p>이곳에 무엇을 써야할 지 잘 모르겠습니다. 도와주실 수 있나요?</p>
        <p>More seriously, there are lot of cool things that users, contributors and reusers do with Open Beauty Facts,
        it would be great to get more people to know about it. In particular, we need help for public
        and <a href="/press">media relations</a>.</p>
        
    </li>   
    
    <li>
        <h3>스페셜 프로젝트</h3>
        <p>There are lots of interesting and original applications of cosmetic open data that we could work on with
        government cosmetic agencies, cosmetic producers, researchers, universities, schools, NGOs etc. 벌써 아이디어가 떠올랐나요?
        그렇다면, 그 아이디어가 개발되고 발전할수 있도록 도와주세요.</p>
