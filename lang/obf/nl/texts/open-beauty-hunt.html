<p id="description">On Saturday February 21st 2019 - <a href=" https://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a> - 
the free and open cosmetics products database <a href="https://openbeautyfacts.org">Open Beauty Facts</a> is launching <b>Open Beauty Hunt</b>,
an operation to open cosmetics products data from as many different countries as possible.</p>

<div style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:20px;width:320px;">
<a href="https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/countries"><img src="https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/images/misc/world-map-2015-02.320x167.png" width="320" height="167" alt="Open Beauty Facts countries map"></a>
</div>


<p>500 contributors have added 9000 products on Open Beauty Facts. 
The database includes products from <a href="https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/countries">more than 100 different countries</a>, but the bulk of them comes from France - where Open Beauty Facts was launched in 2012 -
and from a few countries like Spain, the UK, the US and Belgium where we have some very motivated contributors.
Open Beauty Hunt aims to change that: we are going to add products from the 150 missing countries and try to reach a critical mass of products from as many countries as possible.
Of even greater importance, <b>Open Beauty Hunt aims to create and develop strong local communities of contributors</b>.</p>

<h3>Open Data Day</h3>

<p><em>Beauty is a great way to "show and tell" people about open data</em></p>
</div>

<blockquote style="font-style:italic">"Open Data Day is a gathering of citizens in cities around the world to write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish analyses using open public data to show support for and encourage the adoption open data policies by the world's local, regional and national governments."
</blockquote>

<p>While most open data comes from governments and public bodies, some very useful data is also crowdsourced - collected by individuals - 
like the data used to create <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>.
Beauty products data in Open Beauty Facts is aso crowdsourced by contributors who use their smartphones to scan product barcodes and to take pictures of products, ingredients lists and nutrition facts.</p>

<p><b>Cosmetics is something every human being is interested in</b>, and open cosmetics data can be a very good introduction to open data, as it is useful to everyone (e.g. to decode labels, to compare products, to eat better, and to play !). We hope Open Beauty Facts and Open Beauty Hunt will be presented in many Open Data Day gatherings. If you are organizing an Open Data Day event in your city, we have some slides available online and we would be very happy to exchange with you, so please get in touch!</p>

<h3 style="clear:right">Open Beauty Explorers and Open Beauty Ambassadors</h3>

<p>Starting on Open Data Day and for one week, Open Beauty Facts contributors will become <b>Open Beauty Explorers</b>: their goal will be to add as many products from their country on Open Beauty Facts and to make it reach the next level: from no product to one product, from 1 to 10, 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 1000 to 10000... (and for people in France we have a special goal to go from 25000 to 100000!).</p>

<p>Existing and new contributors will also be invited to become <b>Open Beauty Ambassadors</b> who recruit new contributors, both in their country and outside their country. In particular ambassadors are highly encouraged to present Open Beauty Facts to their family and friends living in countries where we currently have no or few products.</p>

<h3>Open Beauty Hunt friendly competition</h3>

<p>From Saturday February 21st to Sunday March 1st, we will keep track of the top Open Beauty Explorers and Open Beauty Ambassadors.</p>

<p>Open Beauty Explorers will be awarded explorer points for each new product they add:</p>

<ul>    
<li>100 points for the 1st product added to a country (i.e. there are currently no products in Open Beauty Facts for that country)</li>
<li>20 points for each of the first 10 products added to a country</li>
<li>10 points for each of the first 100 products</li>
<li>5 points for each of the first 1000 products</li>
<li>2 points for each of the first 10000 products</li>
<li>1 points for each product after that</li>
</ul>

<p>Points are doubled when the product pages are complete: with pictures for ingredients and nutrition facts and all data entered.</p>

<p>All Open Beauty Explorers and Ambassadors will receive an Open Beauty Facts magnet and sticker and the top Explorers and Ambassadors will receive some small rewards (TBD).</p>

<p>We will also keep track of the total of points for each country.</p>
