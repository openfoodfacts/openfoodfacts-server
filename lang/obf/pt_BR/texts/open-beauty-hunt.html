<p id="description">On Saturday February 21st 2019 - <a href=" https://opendataday.org/">Open Data Day</a> - 
the free and open cosmetics products database <a href="https://openbeautyfacts.org">Open Beauty Facts</a> is launching <b>Open Beauty Hunt</b>,
an operation to open cosmetics products data from as many different countries as possible.</p>

<div style="float:left;margin-right:20px;margin-bottom:20px;width:320px;">
<a href="https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/countries"><img src="https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/images/misc/world-map-2015-02.320x167.png" width="320" height="167" alt="Open Beauty Facts countries map"></a>
</div>


<p>500 contributors have added 9000 products on Open Beauty Facts. 
The database includes products from <a href="https://world.openbeautyfacts.org/countries">more than 100 different countries</a>, but the bulk of them comes from France - where Open Beauty Facts was launched in 2012 -
and from a few countries like Spain, the UK, the US and Belgium where we have some very motivated contributors.
Open Beauty Hunt aims to change that: we are going to add products from the 150 missing countries and try to reach a critical mass of products from as many countries as possible.
Of even greater importance, <b>Open Beauty Hunt aims to create and develop strong local communities of contributors</b>.</p>

<h3>Dia de Dados Abertos</h3>

<p><em>Beauty is a great way to "show and tell" people about open data</em></p>
</div>

<blockquote style="font-style:italic">"O Dia dos Dados Abertos é uma reunião de cidadãos em cidades ao redor do mundo para escrever aplicações, liberar dados, criar visualizações e publicar análises usando dados públicos abertos para mostrar apoio e encorajar a adoção de políticas de dados abertos pelos governos locais, regionais e nacionais do mundo "
</blockquote>

<p>Enquanto a maioria dos dados abertos vem de governos e órgãos públicos, alguns dados muito úteis também são crowdsourced - coletados por indivíduos - como os dados usados ​​para criar <a href="https://openstreetmap.org"> OpenStreetMap </a>.
Beauty products data in Open Beauty Facts is aso crowdsourced by contributors who use their smartphones to scan product barcodes and to take pictures of products, ingredients lists and nutrition facts.</p>

<p><b>Cosmetics is something every human being is interested in</b>, and open cosmetics data can be a very good introduction to open data, as it is useful to everyone (e.g. to decode labels, to compare products, to eat better, and to play !). We hope Open Beauty Facts and Open Beauty Hunt will be presented in many Open Data Day gatherings. Se você estiver organizando um evento do Open Data Day em sua cidade, temos alguns slides disponíveis on-line e ficaremos muito felizes em trocar com você, então, por favor, entre em contato!</p>

<h3 style="clear:right">Open Beauty Explorers and Open Beauty Ambassadors</h3>

<p>Starting on Open Data Day and for one week, Open Beauty Facts contributors will become <b>Open Beauty Explorers</b>: their goal will be to add as many products from their country on Open Beauty Facts and to make it reach the next level: from no product to one product, from 1 to 10, 10 to 100, 100 to 1000, 1000 to 10000... (e para as pessoas na França, temos um objetivo especial de passar de 25.000 a 100.000!).</p>

<p>Existing and new contributors will also be invited to become <b>Open Beauty Ambassadors</b> who recruit new contributors, both in their country and outside their country. In particular ambassadors are highly encouraged to present Open Beauty Facts to their family and friends living in countries where we currently have no or few products.</p>

<h3>Open Beauty Hunt friendly competition</h3>

<p>From Saturday February 21st to Sunday March 1st, we will keep track of the top Open Beauty Explorers and Open Beauty Ambassadors.</p>

<p>Open Beauty Explorers will be awarded explorer points for each new product they add:</p>

<ul>    
<li>100 points for the 1st product added to a country (i.e. there are currently no products in Open Beauty Facts for that country)</li>
<li>20 pontos para cada um dos 10 primeiros produtos adicionados a um país</li>
<li>10 pontos para cada um dos primeiros 100 produtos</li>
<li>5 pontos para cada um dos primeiros 1000 produtos</li>
<li>2 pontos para cada um dos primeiros 10000 produtos</li>
<li>1 pontos para cada produto seguinte</li>
</ul>

<p>Os pontos são duplicados quando as páginas do produto estão completas: com fotos de ingredientes e informações nutricionais e todos os dados inseridos.</p>

</div>


<p>Open Beauty Ambassadors will also receive ambassador points corresponding to the explorer points of all the new contributors they recruit.</p>

<p>All Open Beauty Explorers and Ambassadors will receive an Open Beauty Facts magnet and sticker and the top Explorers and Ambassadors will receive some small rewards (TBD).</p>

<p>Também vamos observar o total de pontos para cada país.</p>
