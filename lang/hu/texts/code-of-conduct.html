<h1>Magatartási kódex</h1>

<p>Open Food Facts is a project driven by a community of volunteers. Everyone is invited to participate, and to make sure everyone feels welcome at all times, we ask that
you interact with kindness and courtesy with other members and that you follow those rules:</p>

<h2>Szabályok</h2>

<h3>Nincs diszkrimináció</h3>

<p>Open Food Facts is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone regardless of age, gender,  sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, or religion.</p>

<h3>No harassment and no threats</h3>

<p>We will not tolerate harassment of participants in any form, or anything that threatens personal safety.</p>

<h3>No direspectful demands to individual contributors</h3>

<p>All Open Food Facts participants and contributors are unpaid volunteers who dedicate time and energy to the project. Please take this into account when you request something from an individual contributor,
and do accept answers like "No," "Not now," "Maybe," and/or "I don't know". Repeated and/or undue pressure to make a contributor do/answer something will be considered as harassment.</p>

<p>Requests that are likely to generate a significant amount of work should be sent to the administrators at contact@openfoodfacts.org and not to individual contributors.</p>


<h2>Consequences of not respecting the code of conduct</h2>

<p>People violating these rules may be temporary blocked or permanently banned from the project at the discretion of the administrators of the Open Food Facts Association.</p>

<p>In particular, bad actors who repeatedly ignore the rules and culture of the project, who are needlessly argumentative or hostile, or who are offensive, and who are unable to self-correct their behavior when asked to do so by others will be permanently banned from the project.</p>



<h2>Reporting abuse</h2>

<p>If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of conduct, please contact us at abuse@openfoodfacts.org to send us an abuse report. 
Please include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.</p>

<p>Your report will be read, treated and answered by Stéphane Gigandet (President of the Open Food Facts Association) and Florentin Raud (initiator of this Code of conduct).</p>

<br/><br>

<p>Note: this code of conduct is inspired by the codes of conduct of other open communities like the <a href="https://contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a>. Feel free to reuse it or part of it.</p>
