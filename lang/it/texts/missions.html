<h1>Missioni</h1>

<p>To help develop Open Food Facts' food database, you can add products and take on missions.</p>

<p>Some of these missions are fun and are intended to make you <a href="">add products</a> that are not in your closet and your refrigerator (but perhaps in those of your neighbor, or in the aisles from a store in your neighborhood where you've never been before).</p>

<p>Others missions correspond to needs: to increase the number of products in a category with few items, or to prepare a comparative study in a given category. For example, if you wish to verify the claims like "25% less salt than the average of the other white hams", it is necessary to get at least 95% of the white hams on the market in order to calculate the average salt content.</p>
