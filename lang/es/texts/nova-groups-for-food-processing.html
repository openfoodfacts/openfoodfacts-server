<h1>Nova groups for food processing</h1>

<h2>A classification in 4 groups to highlight the degree of processing of foods</h2>

<p>In the report "The UN Decade of Nutrition, the NOVA food classification and the trouble with ultra-processing" (<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/public-health-nutrition/article/un-decade-of-nutrition-the-nova-food-classification-and-the-trouble-with-ultraprocessing/2A9776922A28F8F757BDA32C3266AC2A">pdf</a>, <a href="http://archive.wphna.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WN-2016-7-1-3-28-38-Monteiro-Cannon-Levy-et-al-NOVA.pdf">pdf</a>),
Carlos Augusto Monteiro, Geoffrey Cannon, Jean-Claude Moubarac, Renata Bertazzi Levy, Maria Laura C. Louzada and Patrícia Constante Jaime advocate for the adoption of a system of grades from 1 to 4 to allow to simply compare the degree of processing of products.</p>
  
  <p>New research associating researchers from Inserm, Inra and the Paris 13 University (Centre de recherche épidémiologie et statistique Sorbonne Paris Cité, équipe EREN) suggest a correlation between the cosumption of ultra-transformed foods and an increased risk of developing a cancer. </p>

<p>Some countries use the NOVA groups for their dietary guidelines or goals, for instance:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.fao.org/nutrition/education/food-based-dietary-guidelines/regions/countries/brazil/en/">Brazil's dietary guidelines</a> recommend to limit consumption of processed food and avoid ultra-processed food.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.hcsp.fr/Explore.cgi/avisrapportsdomaine?clefr=648">France's public health nutritional policy goals for 2018-2022</a> aims to reduce consumption of group 4 ultra-processed foods by 20%.</li>
  </ul>

  
  The NOVA classification assigns a group to food products based on how much processing they have been through:

<img src="https://static.openfoodfacts.net/images/misc/nova-group-4.svg">
  <br><br>
<ul>
<li>Grupo 1 - Alimentos no procesados o mínimamente procesados</li>
<li>Grupo 2 - Ingredientes culinarios procesados</li>
<li>Grupo 3 - Alimentos procesados</li>
<li>Grupo 4 - Alimentos y bebidas ultraprocesados</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Group 1. Alimentos no procesados ​​o mínimamente procesados</h3>
<p>Unprocessed (or natural) foods are edible parts of plants
(seeds, fruits, leaves, stems, roots) or of animals (muscle,
offal, eggs, milk), and also fungi, algae and water, after
separation from nature. </p>
  <p>Minimally processed foods are
natural foods altered by processes that include removal
of inedible or unwanted parts, and drying, crushing,
grinding, fractioning, filtering, roasting, boiling, non-alcoholic
fermentation, pasteurization, refrigeration, chilling, freezing,
placing in containers and vacuum-packaging. These
processes are designed to preserve natural foods, to make
them suitable for storage, or to make them safe or edible or
more pleasant to consume. Many unprocessed or minimally
processed foods are prepared and cooked at home or in
restaurant kitchens in combination with processed culinary
ingredients as dishes or meals.</p>
  
  <h3>Group 2. Ingredientes culinarios procesados</h3>
<p>Processed culinary ingredients, such as oils, butter, sugar
and salt, are substances derived from Group 1 foods or
from nature by processes that include pressing, refining,
grinding, milling and drying. The purpose of such processes
is to make durable products that are suitable for use
in home and restaurant kitchens to prepare, season and
cook Group 1 foods and to make with them varied and
enjoyable hand-made dishes and meals, such as stews,
soups and broths, salads, breads, preserves, drinks and
desserts. They are not meant to be consumed by themselves,
and are normally used in combination with Group
1 foods to make freshly prepared drinks, dishes and meals.</p>
  
  
<h3>Group 3. Alimentos procesados</h3>
<p>Processed foods, such as bottled vegetables, canned fish,
fruits in syrup, cheeses and freshly made breads, are made
essentially by adding salt, oil, sugar or other substances
from Group 2 to Group 1 foods. </p>
  <p>Processes include various
preservation or cooking methods, and, in the case of
breads and cheese, non-alcoholic fermentation. Most
processed foods have two or three ingredients, and are
recognizable as modified versions of Group 1 foods. They
are edible by themselves or, more usually, in combination
with other foods. The purpose of processing here is to
increase the durability of Group 1 foods, or to modify or
enhance their sensory qualities.</p>
  

<h3>Group 4. Ultra-processed foods</h3>

<p>Ultra-processed foods, such as soft drinks, sweet or
savoury packaged snacks, reconstituted meat products
and pre-prepared frozen dishes, are not modified foods
but formulations made mostly or entirely from substances
derived from foods and additives, with little if any intact Group 1 food.</p>
<p>Ingredients of these formulations usually include those
also used in processed foods, such as sugars, oils, fats or
salt. But ultra-processed products also include other
sources of energy and nutrients not normally used in
culinary preparations. Some of these are directly extracted
from foods, such as casein, lactose, whey and gluten.</p>
<p>Many are derived from further processing of food
constituents, such as hydrogenated or interesterified oils,
UN, NOVA and the trouble with ultra-processing 9
hydrolysed proteins, soya protein isolate, maltodextrin,
invert sugar and high-fructose corn syrup.</p>
<p>Additives in ultra-processed foods include some also
used in processed foods, such as preservatives, antioxidants
and stabilizers. Classes of additives found only in
ultra-processed products include those used to imitate or
enhance the sensory qualities of foods or to disguise
unpalatable aspects of the final product. These additives
include dyes and other colours, colour stabilizers; flavours,
flavour enhancers, non-sugar sweeteners; and processing
aids such as carbonating, firming, bulking and anti-bulking,
de-foaming, anti-caking and glazing agents, emulsifiers,
sequestrants and humectants.</p>
<p>A multitude of sequences of processes is used to
combine the usually many ingredients and to create the
final product (hence 'ultra-processed'). The processes
include several with no domestic equivalents, such as
hydrogenation and hydrolysation, extrusion and moulding,
and pre-processing for frying.</p>
<p>The overall purpose of ultra-processing is to create
branded, convenient (durable, ready to consume), attractive
(hyper-palatable) and highly profitable (low-cost
ingredients) food products designed to displace all other
food groups. Ultra-processed food products are usually
packaged attractively and marketed intensively.</p>

  

<h2>The Nova score on Open Food Facts</h2>

<p>The formula for calculating the Nova score were published in the <a href="http://archive.wphna.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/WN-2016-7-1-3-28-38-Monteiro-Cannon-Levy-et-al-NOVA.pdf">NOVA. The star shines bright</a> article
published in World Nutrition Volume  7, Number 1 - 3, January - March 2016 </p>

<p>Please note that this is still experimental work as multilingual taxonomisation of ingredients is still an ongoing work on Open Food Facts.</p>
