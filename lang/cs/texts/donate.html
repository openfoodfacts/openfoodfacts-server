<p>Děkujeme vám za váš zájem o projekt Open Food Facts a za Vaši podporu!</p>
<h2>A collaborative, free and open database of food products with an increasing impact</h2>
<div>Launched in 2012, the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">Open Food Facts</a> project continues to grow: in 2018, our collaborative, free and open food product database has almost doubled in size, having already quadrupled in 2017! This database is reused for free by over 100 mobile apps and web services and is used by public health research teams.</div>
<div>
    <p>As mentioned in our <a href="https://fr.blog.openfoodfacts.org/news/rapport-d-activite-2017-de-l-association-open-food-facts" hreflang="fr">last activity report</a>, this very rapid growth in the number of products and reuses opens up new perspectives and opportunities, but also presents new challenges that we now need to address.
        <br>
    </p>

    <h2>Human resources at the service of a citizen project</h2></div>
<div>Since 2012, the Open Food Facts project has been entirely run by volunteer citizens grouped together in a 1901 non-profit association. The project is based on citizen gathering (crowdsourcing) to feed the database (on the model of other citizen projects like OpenStreetMap and Wikipedia), and also on volunteers for management and technical development.
    <br>
</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>Open Food Facts has a growing impact, but we also have growing difficulties to cope with the extra work this growth entails. To sustain and extend our action, we will put in place human resources dedicated to the project, who can work there full time, being paid. </div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<div>This will enable a continued growth of the database and will enable addressing the challenges we have identified, and it will also extend the project into new directions (such as extending to new types of products like cosmetics with Open Beauty Facts), or the creation of new services and applications (eg in the field of the fight against waste) etc.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<h2>What will your money be used for?</h2>
<div>Your donations will allow us to pay a small permanent team that can support volunteer contributors and implement the projects we present in <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/2019-roadmap">our 2019 roadmap</a> more efficiently and quickly.</div>
<div>
    <br>
</div>
<h2>Every donation counts!</h2>
<p>The establishment of a permanent team requires funding well above our current budget (less than 1000 euros per year until 2017, but already 25000 euros in 2018), even if the team is very small and part time. But your donations will allow us to start building this small team and allow us to search for and claim other sources of funding (such as public grants and foundations not related to the agri-food industry), and thus to continue to build the Open Food Facts project in a sustainable and incremental way.</p>
<p>If you can, so that we can plan and continue its action in a serene and perennial way, please prefer monthly donations.</p>
<h2>Thank you very much for your support !</h2>
