<h1>Help us complete products and improve the food and health of everyone!</h1>

<h2 class="subheader">Information you add will be used by millions of people to make better food choices and by public health research teams for their studies.</h2>

<p>In order to determine the nutritional quality of a product with the Nutri-Score,
to analyze its degree of processing with NOVA,
or to determine if it suitable for vegans or vegetarians, we need to:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>categorize the product</b></li>
<li><b>extract its list of ingredients</b> (it can often be done very easily by selecting and cropping the ingredient list in product photos
and automatically extracting the text from the photo)</li>
<li><b>add the values from the nutrition facts table</b></li>
</ul>

<p>Filling in other information like the product name, the brand, the labels (e.g. organic and fair trade),
the origins of ingredients, the type of packaging etc. also enables even more features and comparisons.</p>
