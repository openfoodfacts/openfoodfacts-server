		<h2>Expert help needed</h2>
		<p>Developing Open Food Facts also requires specialized knowledge and expertise in many different areas:</p>
	</div>
</div>

<ul class="text-center small-block-grid-1 medium-block-grid-2 large-block-grid-3">
	<li>
		<h3>Project management</h3>
		<p>We have tons of ideas and you probably have even more, but it is quite a challenge to prioritize them,
to build a roadmap, and to manage projects when every participant is a volunteer with often limited time available.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Design</h3>
		<p>We need help to build a better user experience on the Open Food Facts web site and mobile app, to improve
their design, to create impactful presentation materials etc.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Development</h3>
		<p>Máme <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org/development">veľa práce s vývojom</a>. 
      On the Open Food Facts backend (Perl and MongoDB), API (JSON),
      web site (templatized HTML5, JS, Foundation), iOS and Android apps (a <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-androidapp">Java/Kotlin version</a> 
      on Android, and <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-ios">a Swift version on iOS</a>, both needing volunteers), 
      but also to build new cool reuses etc.
      We have projects in many programming languages to ensure anyone can reuse and contribute to Open Food Facts, in any language. 
      Taktiež zvyšujeme úsilie v oblasti umelej inteligencie na zjednodušenie práce s príspevkami.
      Náš kód sa nachádza na <a href="https://github.com/openfoodfacts">GitHub</a>-e.
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Community building</h3>
		<p>We need to build local communities in all countries and at the same time unite them globally.</p>
		<p>It is very difficult to bootstrap a local community in a country without living there, so your help
		to find the first very motivated participants is essential. Are you one of them?</p>
	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Communication</h3>
		<p>We are not sure what to write here, could you help?</p>
		<p>More seriously, there are lot of cool things that users, contributors and reusers do with Open Food Facts,
		it would be great to get more people to know about it. In particular, we need help for public
		and <a href="/press">media relations</a>.</p>

	</li>

	<li>
		<h3>Special projects</h3>
		<p>There are lots of interesting and original applications of food open data that we could work on with
		government food agencies, food producers, researchers, universities, schools, NGOs etc. Maybe you already have ideas?
		If you do, please help us to push them forward.</p>

      Môžete dokonca pomôcť pridať kategóriu potravín alebo štítok, ktorý ešte nie je podporovaný Open Food Facts.</p>
