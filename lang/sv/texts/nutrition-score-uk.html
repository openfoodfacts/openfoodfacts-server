<h1>Nutrition Score - UK</h1>

<p>We are in the process of implementing the <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/northern-ireland/nutritionni/niyoungpeople/nutlab/nutprofmod">Food Standards Agency nutrition score</a> on food products in Open Food Facts.</p>

<p>Please note that the current score does not take into account the amount of fruits, vegetables and nuts yet. Vi jobbar på det.</p>
