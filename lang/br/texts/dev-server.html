		<h3>The intelligence behind the Open Food Facts apps and API</h3>
		<p>
		Open Food Facts collects data using a WRITE API, processes it and makes it available using a READ API and a web version. Computing the Nutri-Score, NOVA groups, extracting additives, regardless of their language, synonyms or potential spelling mistakes. This is just a tiny fraction of the topics covered by the server team, to ensure food transparency at planetary scale.

		<h3>Contribute to the Core using Perl</h3>
		<p>Fellout a rafe deoc'h deski√± ur yezh nevez? The Server is mainly coded in Perl. Whether you're a seasoned Perl addict, or have just touched Perl for sys-admin tasks, there's a bug your size, and mentors to guide you. And also more than one way to do it ;-)

		<h3>Create useful tools in any language</h3>
		<p>HungerGames is the example of a little game coded in react that's having a positive impact on Open Food Facts. LanguageSwitcher, another tool, is coded in Python. Your tool, your language (please avoid Assembler ;-)
