  ### What each part means
  
  **`[% panel.website %]`**
  This is Template Toolkit syntax (Perl's templating system). `panel` refers to the `$panel_data_ref` hash you passed in Step 1, and `.website` accesses the `website` key from it. So it gets replaced at runtime with the actual URL like `https://www.someproduct.com`.
  
  **The double backticks ` `` ` around the HTML**
  As explained in the `create_panel_from_json_template` docs in the file itself, double backticks mean "convert this multiline string, removing line breaks and extra spaces." It's a special feature of this project's template system, not standard JSON. You must use it for any HTML string in these templates.
  
  **`"element_type": "text"`**
  Tells the mobile app / frontend that this element contains text/HTML.
  
  **`"level": "info"`**
  Visual styling level. Other panels use `"info"`, `"warning"`, `"trivia"` etc.
  
  **`"parent_panel_id": "product_card"`**
  Tells the system this panel belongs under the product card section.
  
  **`"type": "raw"`**
  This is the key part matching the issue title — "Raw Knowledge Panel". It means the data is exposed as-is without special formatting.
  
  ### How to verify it works
  
  Look at an existing simple template like:
  ```
