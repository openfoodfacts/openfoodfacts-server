=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2  generate_cache_key($name, $context_ref)

Generate a key to use for caching, that depends on the content of the $context_ref object.
The key is prependend by the name of the variable we want to store, so that we can set multiple variables for the same context
(e.g. a count of search results + the search results themselves)

=head3 Arguments

=head4 $name Name of the variable we want to cache.

=head4 $object_ref Reference to all the context / parameters etc. that have an influence on what we want to cache

=head3 Return values

MD5 of the key.

	# even if it contains hashes (Storable::freeze may not have the same order of keys)
