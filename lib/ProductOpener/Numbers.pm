=head1 NAME

ProductOpener::Numbers - normalize numbers sent as strings in various formats
with different sets of separators for digit grouping and to indicate decimals.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=cut

package ProductOpener::Numbers;

use ProductOpener::PerlStandards;
use Exporter qw< import >;

use Log::Any qw($log);

BEGIN {
	use vars qw(@ISA @EXPORT_OK %EXPORT_TAGS);
	@EXPORT_OK = qw(

		&remove_insignificant_digits
		&convert_string_to_number

	);    # symbols to export on request
	%EXPORT_TAGS = (all => [@EXPORT_OK]);
}

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 remove_insignificant_digits($)

Some apps send us nutrient values that they have stored internally as
floating point numbers.

So we get values like:

2.9000000953674
1.6000000238419
0.89999997615814
0.359999990463256
2.5999999046326

On the other hand, when we get values like 2.0, 2.50 or 2.500,
we want to keep the trailing 0s.

The goal is to keep the precision if it makes sense. The tricky part
is that we do not know in advance how many significant digits we can have,
it varies from products to products, and even nutrients to nutrients.

The desired output is thus:

2.9000000953674 -> 2.9
1.6000000238419 -> 1.6
0.89999997615814 -> 0.9
0.359999990463256 -> 0.36
2.5999999046326 -> 2.6
2 -> 2
2.0 -> 2.0
2.000 -> 2.000
2.0001 -> 2
0.0001 -> 0.0001

=cut

sub remove_insignificant_digits ($value) {

	# Make the value a string
	$value .= '';

	# Very small values may have been converted to scientific notation

	if ($value =~ /\.(\d*?[1-9]\d*?)0{3}/) {
		$value = $` . '.' . $1;
	}
	elsif ($value =~ /([1-9]0*)\.0{3}/) {
		$value = $` . $1;
	}
	elsif ($value =~ /\.(\d*)([0-8]+)9999/) {
		$value = $` . '.' . $1 . ($2 + 1);
	}
	elsif ($value =~ /\.9999/) {
		$value = $` + 1;
	}
	return $value;
}

=head2 convert_string_to_number($)

Try to convert a number represented as a string to the actual number,
by guessing which characters (spaces, commas, dots) are used as
digit grouping separators or used to indicate decimals.

=cut

sub convert_string_to_number ($value) {

	$value =~ s/(\d) (\d)/$1$2/g;

	# In some languages like French, a comma is used instead of a dot to indicate decimals
	# If we have 1 and only 1 comma, and no dot, change the comma to a dot
	if (($value !~ /\./) and ($value !~ /,.*,/)) {
		$value =~ s/,/\./;
	}
	# Number sent by a Spanish producer: 3,697,00 -> 3697
	# consider the last comma is the decimal separator if we have exactly 2 digits after
	elsif ($value =~ /,\d\d$/) {
		$value =~ s/,(\d\d)$/.$1/;
	}
	# Remove remaining commas that can be used as separators
	$value =~ s/,//g;
	$value += 0;

	return $value;
}
