=head1 NAME

ProductOpener::HTTP - utility functions around http (handling headers, cookies, redirect, etc.)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

C<ProductOpener::Web> consists of functions used only in OpenFoodFacts website for different tasks.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The module implements http utilities to use in different part of the code.

FIXME: a lot of functions in Display.pm should be moved here.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 get_cors_headers($allow_credentials = 0, $sub_domain_only = 0)

We handle CORS headers from Perl code, NGINX should not interfere.
So this is the central place for it.

Some parts needs to be more strict than others (eg. auth).

=head3 Parameters

=head4 $allow_credentials - boolean

Whether we should add the Access-Control-Allow-Credential header, should be used with caution.
We will effectively put the headers only if subdomains matches.

We need to send the header Access-Control-Allow-Credentials=true so that websites
such has hunger.openfoodfacts.org that send a query to world.openfoodfacts.org/cgi/auth.pl
can read the resulting response.

=head4 $sub_domain_only - boolean

If true tells to restrict Access to main domain, that is domain.tld (eg. openfoodfacts.org)
It defaults to False,
but as a precaution, setting $allow_credentials to True turns it to True, if allow-credentials is given.


=head3 returns

Reference to a Hashmap with headers.

This function write cors_headers in response.
