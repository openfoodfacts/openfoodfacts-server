=head1 NAME

ProductOpener::ProductsFeatures - Specify which features (e.g. ingredient list, Nutri-Score) are available for a specific product

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<ProductOpener::ProductsFeatures> is used to turn on or off specific features for a product.

Currently, product features are determined using the product type (e.g. food, pet food, beauty products).

In the future, we may have features that depend on other attributes of the product (for instance its category)
