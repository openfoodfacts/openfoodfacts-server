ProductOpener::Test - utility functions used by unit and integration tests

=head2 remove_all_products ()

For integration tests, we need to start from an empty database, so that the results of the tests
are not affected by previously existing content.

This function should only be called by tests, and never on production environments.

=cut

sub remove_all_products () {
    # check we are not on a prod database, by checking there are not more than 100 products
    my $products_count = execute_query(sub {
		return get_products_collection()->count_documents({});
	});
    unless ((0 <= $products_count) && ($products_count < 1000)) {
        die("Refusing to run destructive test on a DB of more than 100 items");
    }
    # clean database
    execute_query(sub {
		return get_products_collection()->delete_many({});
	});
    # clean files
    remove_tree("$data_root/products", {keep_root => 1, error => \my $err});
    if (@$err) {
        die("not able to remove some products directories: ". join(":", @$err));
    }
}

=head2 compare_csv_file_to_expected_results($csv_file, $expected_results_dir, $update_expected_results)

Compare a CSV file containing product data (e.g. the result of a CSV export) to expected results.

The expected results are stored as individual JSON files for each of the product,
in files named [barcode].json, with a flat key/value pairs structure corresponding to the CSV columns.

This is so that we can easily see diffs with git diffs:
- we know how many products are affected
- we see individual diffs with the field name

=head3 Arguments

=head4 $csv_file - CSV file to compare

=head4 $expected_results_dir - directory containing the individual JSON files

=head4 $update_expected_results - flag to indicate to save test results as expected results

Tests will pass when this flag is passed, and the new expected results can be diffed / commited in GitHub.
