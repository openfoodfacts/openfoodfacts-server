To start, follow the ssh instructions on Gitpod's official guide: SSH for workspaces as easy as copy/paste.

Run only once, then use the <code>up</code>, <code>down</code>, <code>restart</code> commands. <code>make build</code> build containers. Add <code>container=name</code> to build a specific container args=\"--progress log\" keeps all log in console (to debug failing build) <code>make up</code> Start containers. <code>make down</code> Stop containers and keep the volumes. Products and users data will be kept. <code>make hdown</code> Stop containers and delete the volumes (hard down). Products and users data will be lost ! <code>make restart</code> Restart <code>frontend</code> and <code>backend</code> containers. <code>make reset</code> Run <code>hdown</code> and <code>up</code>. <code>make status</code> Get containers status (up, down, fail). <code>make log</code> Get logs. Include only logs written to container's <code>stdout</code>. <code>make tail</code> Get other logs (<code>Apache</code>, <code>mod_perl</code>, ...) bound to the local <code>logs/</code> directory. <code>make prune</code> Save space by removing unused Docker artifacts. Next build will take time (no cache) ! <code>make prune_cache</code> Remove Docker build cache. Next build will take time (no build cache) ! <code>make clean</code> Clean up your dev environment: removes locally bound folders, run <code>hdown</code> and <code>prune</code>. Run <code>make dev</code> to recreate a fresh dev env afterwards. <code>make import_sample_data</code> Load sample data (~100 products) into the MongoDB database. <code>make import_prod_data</code> Load latest prod data (~2M products, 1.7GB) into the MongoDB database. Takes up to 10m. Not recommended for dev setups ! <code>make lint</code> Indent and reformat your code<sup>1</sup> <ol> <li> <p>If you are having permission issues with <code>make lint</code> try writing the following commands : <code>export MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose run --rm --no-deps -u root backend chown www-data:www-data -R /opt/product-opener/</code> then run again <code>make lint</code> and you should be good to go\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"dev/ref-perl-pod/","title":"Perl reference documentation","text":"<p>Do not write anything here, it is meant to be overwritten by html generated by perl pod.</p>"},{"location":"dev/ref-perl/","title":"Reference Perl code documentation","text":"<p>The documentation in Plain Old Format (aka POD) for perl module is compiled from in file documentation.</p> <p>See the Perl reference documentation</p>"}]}
