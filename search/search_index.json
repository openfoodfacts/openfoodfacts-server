All data is stored in a single <code>/data</code> folder.</p> <p>Data is synchronized monthly between the Open Food Facts server and the bucket; as such some recent images are likely missing. You should not assume all images are present in the bucket.</p> <p>To know the bucket key associated with an image for the product with barcode '4012359114303', you should first split the barcode as follows: <code>/401/235/911/4303</code> (that is, three groups of 3 digits followed by one group of 4 digits, all four groups being prefixed with a <code>/</code>).</p> <p>This splitting is only relevant for EAN13 (13-digit barcodes): for barcodes with fewer digits (like EAN8), the directory path is not split: <code>/20065034</code>.</p> <p>To get the raw image '1' for barcode '4012359114303', simply add the image ID: <code>/401/235/911/4303/1.jpg</code>. Here, you will get the \"raw\" image, as sent by the contributor. If you don't need the full resolution image, a 400px resized version is also available, by adding the <code>.400</code> suffix after the image ID: <code>/401/235/911/4303/1.400.jpg</code>.</p> <p>The OCR of the image is a gzipped JSON file, and has the same file name as the raw image, but with the <code>.json.gz</code> extension: <code>/401/235/911/4303/1.json.gz</code></p> <p>To download images, you can either use AWS CLI, or perform an HTTP request directly:</p> <p><code>wget https://openfoodfacts-images.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/data/401/235/911/4303/1.jpg</code></p> <p>You can list all existing objects (images, OCR results) in the bucket by downloading the gzipped text file <code>s3://openfoodfacts-images/data/data_keys.gz</code>:</p> <p><code>wget https://openfoodfacts-images.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/data/data_keys.gz</code></p> <p>Then you can easily filter the files you want using <code>grep</code> (raw images, OCR JSON) before downloading them. For example, to keep only 400px versions of all images:</p> <p><code>zcat data_keys.gz | grep '.400.jpg'</code></p> <p>For example, if you want to extract a sample of images, you can use the code snippet below:</p> <pre><code># Extract images from AWS\nn=1000\nimages_dir=\"images\"\nbucket_url=\"https://openfoodfacts-images.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/\"\n\nzcat data_keys.gz |\ngrep '.jpg' | # Filter\nshuf -n \"$n\" | # Random sample\nsed \"s|^|$bucket_url|\" | #Add bucket_url: \"https://openfoodfacts-images.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/data/376/005/047/0099/1.jpg\"\nwhile read -r url; do\n    filename=$(echo \"$url\" | sed \"s|$bucket_url||\" | tr '/' '_' | sed 's|data_||') # Filename as 376_005_047_0099_1.jpg\n    wget -O \"$images_dir/$filename\" \"$url\"\ndone\n</code></pre> <p>You can further refine the image extraction process by applying additional filters like <code>last_editor</code> or <code>last_edited_date</code>. This can be done by combining the Open Food Facts database dump with DuckDB and the <code>data_keys.gz</code> file.

To start, follow the ssh instructions on Gitpod's official guide: SSH for workspaces as easy as copy/paste.  Once you have copied the ssh command and ensure it works as-is, add a <code>-L 80:localhost:80</code> to the command to make it look like: <code>ssh -L 80:localhost:80 'openfoodfac-openfoodfac-tok-openfoodfac-r9f61214h9vt.ssh.ws-c.gitpod.io'</code>.</p> <p>Once you execute the altered command in your terminal, you should be able to access Open Food Facts on http://openfoodfacts.localhost just as documented in the quickstart guide!</p> <p>Remark: you will need to trust the fingerprint at first connection. </p> <p>Remark: for some Linux distributions, port 80 is reserved.
