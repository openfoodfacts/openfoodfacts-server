=head1 NAME


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Excel file that contains packaging data for Intermarché / Les Mousquetaires products
has 1 line for each product / packaging component / packaging material combination.

Packaging components can have multiple materials (e.g. a lid may be 95% steel and 5% plastic),
which is currently not supported in the OFF packagings structure.

This script filters the CSV file corresponding to the Excel file in order to keep only
the dominant material of each packaging component.
