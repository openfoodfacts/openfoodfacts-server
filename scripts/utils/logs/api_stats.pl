# This script operates on nginx log files that contain API product requests

# The log files must be filtered first to keep only the API requests and the
# apps you care about.
#
# e.g.
# grep "Official Android" api.20200716 > api.20200716.android
# -> the user agent has changed, it used to be "Official Android App"
# and is now "Open Food Facts Official Android App"
# for ios, grep org.openfoodfacts.scanner
# old app in 2018:
# grep "nutrition_data_per" api.20200716 | grep "okhttp" > api.20200716.android-old-app
#
# cat api.20200716.ios api.20200928.ios | ./api_stats.pl
