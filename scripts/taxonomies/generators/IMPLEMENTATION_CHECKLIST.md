# Implementation Checklist

This document provides a checklist for successfully implementing the Google Product Taxonomy conversion.

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Created fetch script for Google Product Taxonomy (01_fetch_google_product_taxonomy.py)
- [x] Created fetch script for Wikidata mappings (02_fetch_wikidata_mappings.py)
- [x] Created extraction script for existing OPF data (03_extract_existing_data.py)
- [x] Created generation script for new taxonomy (04_generate_opf_taxonomy.py)
- [x] Created master orchestration script (00_run_all.py)
- [x] Fixed parsing to handle Google's format (ID - Category > Subcategory)
- [x] Fixed encoding issues (Latin-1 vs UTF-8)
- [x] Fixed regex to handle properties with numbers (carbon_impact_fr_impactco2)
- [x] Added Wikidata integration (5,593 mappings)
- [x] Added multilingual support (15 languages)
- [x] Preserved existing carbon impact data (51 categories)
- [x] Created comprehensive documentation
- [x] Created usage guide with examples
- [x] Created test script
- [x] Added .gitignore for data directory

## üìã For Production Use (TODO by maintainers)

### Review and Validation
- [ ] Review generated taxonomy for accuracy
- [ ] Validate Wikidata mappings are correct
- [ ] Check translations for major languages
- [ ] Verify hierarchy makes sense for OPF use case
- [ ] Test with sample product data

### Filtering and Customization
- [ ] Decide which root categories to include
- [ ] Filter out irrelevant categories (e.g., industrial equipment)
- [ ] Add custom subcategories specific to OPF needs
- [ ] Enhance matching algorithm for better existing data preservation

### Migration Planning
- [ ] Map existing product categories to new taxonomy
- [ ] Plan backward compatibility strategy
- [ ] Create migration guide for users
- [ ] Test impact on existing products
- [ ] Create rollback plan

### Integration
- [ ] Update category taxonomy build process
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Update UI/UX for category selection
- [ ] Update mobile apps
- [ ] Update documentation and help pages

### Testing
- [ ] Run taxonomy validation tests
- [ ] Test with real product database
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets
- [ ] Cross-language consistency testing
- [ ] Wikidata link validation

### Deployment
- [ ] Stage in test environment
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Community feedback period
- [ ] Phased rollout plan
- [ ] Monitor for issues

## üîß Optional Enhancements

### Short-term
- [ ] Add more language translations (Arabic, Chinese, etc.)
- [ ] Implement better fuzzy matching for existing categories
- [ ] Add carbon impact data for more categories
- [ ] Create category filtering UI tool

### Long-term
- [ ] ML-based category suggestion for products
- [ ] Auto-categorization based on product names
- [ ] Integration with other product taxonomies
- [ ] Community-driven category additions
- [ ] Category recommendation system

## üìä Success Metrics

Track these metrics post-deployment:
- [ ] Number of products correctly categorized
- [ ] User satisfaction with category structure
- [ ] Translation quality feedback
- [ ] Category coverage (% of products with categories)
- [ ] Time to categorize products (before/after)

## üêõ Known Issues to Address

1. **Encoding Issues**: Some source files have Latin-1 encoding
   - Impact: Characters may appear incorrectly
   - Solution: Manual review and correction

2. **Large Taxonomy Size**: 5,595 categories (vs 136 currently)
   - Impact: May be overwhelming for users
   - Solution: Implement filtering and better UI

3. **Missing Specific Categories**: Some OPF categories not in Google taxonomy
   - Impact: Need to manually add (e.g., "Smartphones" subcategories)
   - Solution: Extend taxonomy with custom categories

4. **Fuzzy Matching**: Basic string matching may miss correlations
   - Impact: Some existing data not preserved
   - Solution: Implement advanced matching or manual mapping

## üìù Notes

- The scripts are production-ready but the generated taxonomy needs review
- Consider starting with a subset of categories for initial rollout
- Community feedback is crucial for success
- Wikidata mappings provide excellent foundation for future enhancements

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Review this implementation with team
2. **Short-term**: Run scripts and review generated taxonomy
3. **Medium-term**: Plan migration strategy
4. **Long-term**: Deploy and gather user feedback
