revert_changes_from_user.pl

This script will revert products
to the most recent version before a given user changed the product.
Products that did not exist before will be deleted.
All changes done after the first edit of the user will also be deleted,
even if done by other users.

Usage:

revert_changes_from_user.pl --userid user_id --pretend

it is likely that the MongoDB cursor of products to be updated will expire, 
and the script will have to be re-run.

--pretend	do not actually update products
