## Indice de réparabilité

The `ir_data2opf_csv.py` script takes a CSV file as input, and convert it into another CSV file ready to be imported into Open Products Facts Pro Platform (recommanded) or through `csv2product_opener.py` script.


## Sources

The source of the data is published on the French national open data platform:
https://www.data.gouv.fr/datasets/fichiers-consolides-des-donnees-respectant-le-schema-indice-de-reparabilite/

To convert the data we have produced a mapping between source data and target data, the [`mapping.csv` file](./mapping.csv).

## Process

All the process is documented in the following [notebook](./notebook.md). It contains script usages, source file extracts, etc.

The notebook is generated by Quarto from [notebook.qmd](./notebook.qmd), with the following command:

```bash
quarto render notebook.qmd
```
