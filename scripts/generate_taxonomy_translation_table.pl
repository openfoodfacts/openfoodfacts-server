generate_taxonomy_translation_table.pl - Generate a translation table for selected entries in taxonomy in selected languages

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script was created to generate a translation table for rare crops in the ingredients taxonomy, to provide an easy way to review translations
of ingredients of interest for partners of the DIVINFOOD project about Neglected and Underutilized Crops (NUCs).

We may make this script more general in the future if we have similar uses.
