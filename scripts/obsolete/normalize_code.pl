update_all_products.pl is a script that updates the latest version of products in the file system and on MongoDB.
It is used in particular to re-run tags generation when taxonomies have been updated.

Usage:

update_all_products.pl --key some_string_value --fields categories,labels --index

The key is used to keep track of which products have been updated. If there are many products and field to updates,
it is likely that the MongoDB cursor of products to be updated will expire, and the script will have to be re-run.

--query some_field=some_value (e.g. categories_tags=en:beers)	filter the products (--query parameters can be repeated to have multiple filters)
--query some_field=-some_value	match products that don't have some_value for some_field
--query some_field=value1,value2	match products that have value1 and value2 for some_field (must be a _tags field)
--query some_field=value1\|value2	match products that have value1 or value2 for some_field (must be a _tags field)
