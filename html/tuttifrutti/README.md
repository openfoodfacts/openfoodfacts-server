# OFF-Graph Comparator: standalone version
This is the **standalone** version of the [OpenFoodFacts Product Comparator](https://github.com/oricdev/off_product_comparator)
running locally in a browser with all functionalities (except *barcode-scanning* so far).

You can use it for **Educational** purposes, to see how the whole staff works, to
enhance it, or to develop your own graphs using the server-side
 [API](https://offgraphs.blogspot.com/2018/09/api-usage-for-getting-similar-products.html).

It is fully developed using *HTML*, *CSS*, *Javascript*, along with *JQuery* and *D3.js*.

Feel free to develop your own open source graphs and to share them!

## How to install

- download the zip file locally (PC, smartphone)
- unzip the file to a directory of your choice
- from this directory, launch the file *index.html* using your preferred browser

That's it.

__*Note*__: on *Android* smartphones, the *barcode-scanner* can be activated using the extra
[zxing App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.zxing.client.android&hl=en_US)
as explained [here](https://offgraphs.blogspot.com/2018/09/create-your-off-graph-app.html).

Feel free to enhance this project with another *barcode-scanner* and, why not, build your own *App*
with it.

Have fun!
