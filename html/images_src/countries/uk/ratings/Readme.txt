Rating values and keys

The rating value is the result of an inspection for a business. These are different between scheme types. The FHIS uses status messages only, while FHRS uses either a rating (between 0 and 5) or a status. See below for a complete list.

The rating key can be used by developers to decide which rating image to show within their application. The keys correspond to images available on the FSA website (http://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data-resources/images/images.zip). Images have been made available in three sizes and should not be modified in any way. Images supplied by the FSA must only be used in accordance with the Terms and Conditions below (also at: www.food.gov.uk/ratings-terms-and-conditions).

Supported cultures are English and Welsh (en-GB and cy-GB). Images available are: 

* large: 290 x 147 pixels (72ppi; 163ppi; 326ppi)
* medium: 185 x 43 pixels (72ppi, 163ppi, 326ppi)
* small: 120 x 61 pixels (72ppi)
