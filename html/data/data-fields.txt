This file describes the fields from the CSV export of the products in the Open Food Facts database.

See https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data for more information.

The file encoding is Unicode UTF-8. The character that separates fields is <tab> (tabulation).

Generalities:

- fields that end with _t are dates in the UNIX timestamp format (number of seconds since Jan 1st 1970)
- fields that end with _datetime are dates in the iso8601 format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mn:ssZ
- fields that end with _tags are comma separated list of tags (e.g. categories_tags is the set of normalized tags computer from the categories field)
- fields that end with a language 2 letter code (e.g. fr for French) is the set of tags in that language
- fields that end with _100g correspond to the amount of a nutriment (in g, or kJ for energy, or kJ for energy-kj or kcal for energy-kcal) for 100 g or 100 ml of product
- fields that end with _serving correspond to the amount of a nutriment (in g, or kJ for energy, or kJ for energy-kj or kcal for energy-kcal) for 1 serving of the product

Please do not use _unit and _value. Those are NOT normalized values. Please use _100g fields (or _serving when relevant)
