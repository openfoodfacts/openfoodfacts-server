- fields that end with _datetime are dates in the iso8601 format: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mn:ssZ
- fields that end with _tags are comma separated list of tags (e.g. categories_tags is the set of normalized tags computed from the categories field)
- fields that end with a language 2 letter code (e.g. fr for French) is the set of tags in that language
- fields that end with _100g correspond to the amount of a nutriment (in g, or kJ for energy) for 100 g or 100 ml of product
- fields that end with _serving correspond to the amount of a nutriment (in g, or kJ for energy) for 1 serving of the product
