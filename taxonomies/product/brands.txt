# All brands in the brands taxonomy are language less and use the xx: prefix
# Brands are not translated, we record what is written on the package, and we display it back as-is

# Adding brands in the taxonomy allows to:
# - display proper capitalization and accentuation
# - handle variations using the synonyms (e.g. missing or added separators like ' or spaces, possibly missing 's)

# The brands taxonomy should not be used to:
# - handle misspelings (do not add misspellings in the taxonomy as synonyms)
# - handle parent / child brands (too much potential for errors and conflicts, especially in an international setting and with products from different types)
# Note: an old draft owners/brands taxonomy lives in taxonomies/unused/brands.txt, but it is hierarchic, which is something we do not want in this taxonomy.
# You can usefully read: https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Brands to get up and running on the subtleties of the topic.
