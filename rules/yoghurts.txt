# Product rules to categorize yoghurts more finely based on their ingredients

# General rules syntax:

# name: a name to identify the rule

# description: an explanation of what the rule does

# conditions: 1 or more conditions, in the same format as the search API v2 (makes copy and pasting easy to test rules)
# e.g. https://world.openfoodfacts.org/search?categories_tags_en=yoghurts,-sweetened%20yoghurts&ingredients_tags_en=sugar
# - conditions are comma separated, and can also be specified on several conditions: lines
# - conditions on tags can be specified with English names (e.g. categories_tags_en=cakes) or ids (categories_tags=en:cakes)
# Using English names is more resilient if the taxonomy changes (e.g. if the main id of the entry changes)

# - actions: 1 or more actions separated by commas
# +categories_tags_en=yoghurts with fruits : adds a tag
# -categories_tags_en=yoghurts with fruits : removes a tag
