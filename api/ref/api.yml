      operationId: get-search
      description: |
        Search request allows you to get products that match your search criteria.

        It allows you create many custom APIs for your use case.

        If the search query parameter has 2 possible values, they are seperated by a comma(,).
        When filtering via a parameter that has different language codes like `fr`, `de` or `en`, specify the language code in the parameter name e.g `categories_tags_en`

        **Important:** search API v2 does not support full text request (search_term),
        you have to use [search API v1](https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/API/Read/Search) for that.
        Upcoming [search-a-licious project](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/search-a-licious) will fix that.

        ### Limiting results

        You can limit the size of returned objects thanks to the `fields` object (see below).

        eg: `fields=code,product_name,brands,attribute_groups``

        Please use it as much as possible to avoid overloading the servers.

        The search use pagination, see `page` and `page_size` parameters.

        **Beware:** the `page_count` data in item is a bit counter intuitive…, read the description.

        ### Conditions on tags

        All `_tags`` parameters accepts either:

        * a single value
        * or a comma-separated list of values (doing a AND)
        * or a pipe separated list of values (doing a OR)

        You can exclude terms by using a "-" prefix.

        For taxonomized entries, you might either use the tag id (recommended),
        or a known synonym (without language prefix)

        * `labels_tags=en:organic,en:fair-trade` find items that are fair-trade AND organic
        * `labels_tags=en:organic|en:fair-trade` find items that are fair-trade OR organic
        * `labels_tags=en:organic,en:-fair-trade` find items that are organic BUT NOT fair-trade


        ### Conditions on nutriments

        To get a list of nutrients

        You can either query on nutrient per 100g (`_100g` suffix)
        or per serving (`serving` suffix).

        You can also add `_prepared_`
        to get the nutrients in the prepared product instead of as sold.

        You can add a comparison operator and value to the parameter name
        to get products with nutrient above or bellow a value.
        If you use a parameter value it exactly match it.

        * `energy-kj_100g<200` products where energy in kj for 100g is less than 200kj
        * `sugars_serving>10` products where sugar per serving is greater than 10g
        * `saturated-fat_100g=1` products where saturated fat per 100g is exactly 10g
        * `salt_prepared_serving<0.1` products where salt per serving for prepared product is less than 0.1g

        The allowed values  used to sort/order the search results.

        * `product_name` sorts on name
        * `ecoscore_score`, `nova_score`, `nutriscore_score` rank on the [Eco-Score](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/eco-score-the-environmental-impact-of-food-products), [Nova](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/nova), or [Nutri-Score](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/nutriscore)
        * `scans_n`, `unique_scans_n` and `popularity_key` are about product popularity: number of scans on unique scans, rank of product
        * `created_t`, `last_modified_t`, are about creation and modification dates
        * `nothing`, tells not to sort at all (because if you do not provide the sort_by argument we default to sorting on popularity (for food) or last modification date)
