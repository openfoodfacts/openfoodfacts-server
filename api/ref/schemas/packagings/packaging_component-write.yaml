  Each packaging component has different properties to specify how many there are, its shape, material etc.

  The shape, material and recycling properties will be mapped to one entry in the packaging_shapes, packaging_materials and packaging_recycling taxonomies.

  For input, clients can either pass the id of a corresponding taxonomy entry (e.g. "en:pizza-box"), or a free text value prefixed with the language code of the text (e.g. "en:Pizza box", "fr:boite à pizza"). If the language code prefix is missing, the value of the "lc" field of the query will be used.

  The resulting structure will contain the id of the canonical entry in the taxonomy if it good be matched, or the free text value prefixed with the language code otherwise.

  For weights, the API is expecting a number with the number of grams. If a string is passed instead of a number, we will attempt to convert it to grams. The string may contain units (e.g. "6.9 g"), and use . or , as the decimal separator. Conversion may not work for all inputs. If a string was converted to a number, the API response will include a warning and specify the converted value.

      id: 'en:plastic'
    recycling:
      id: 'en:recycle'
    quantity_per_unit: 25 cl
    weight_measured: 10
properties:
  number_of_units:
    type: integer
    description: Number of units of this packaging component contained in the product (e.g. 6 for a pack of 6 bottles)
  shape:
    $ref: ./shape-write.yaml
  material:
    $ref: ./material-write.yaml
  recycling:
    $ref: ./recycling-write.yaml
  quantity_per_unit:
    type: string
    description: Quantity (weight or volume) of food product contained in the packaging component. (e.g. 75cl for a wine bottle)
  weight_specified:
    type:
      - 'number'
      - 'string'
    description: 'Weight (as specified by the manufacturer) of one unit of the empty packaging component (in grams). (e.g. for a 6 pack of 1.5l water bottles, it might be 30, the weight in grams of 1 empty water bottle without its cap which is a different packaging component). If passed a string - possibly with an unit - it will be converted to a number.'
  weight_measured:
    type:
      - 'number'
      - 'string'
    description: 'Weight (as measured by one or more users) of one unit of the empty packaging component (in grams). (e.g. for a 6 pack of 1.5l water bottles, it might be 30, the weight in grams of 1 empty water bottle without its cap which is a different packaging component). If passed a string - possibly with an unit - it will be converted to a number.'
  brands:
    type: string
    description: 'A comma separated list of brands / product names for the packaging component (e.g. "Tetra Pak", Tetra Brik"'
  labels:
    type: string
    description: 'A comma separated list of labels, canonicalized with the packaging_labels taxonomy (e.g. "en:FSC, fr:Encre végétale")'
