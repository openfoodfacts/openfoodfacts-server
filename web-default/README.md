This directory contains a minimal number of texts required to run Product Opener.

The complete set of texts and their translations are managed in the openfoodfacts-web repo.
The "lang" folded of openfoodfacts-web should be copied to the root of the openfoodfacts-server instance, and it will take precedence over "lang-default".
