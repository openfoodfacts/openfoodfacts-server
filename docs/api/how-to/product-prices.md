### Open Prices
* Open Prices is a project to collect and share prices of food products around the world. Itâ€™s a publicly available dataset that can be used for research, analysis, and more. Open Prices is developed and maintained by Open Food Facts.
* We are crowdsourcing an open-source dataset of food prices. Prices can be added by users through our web app. Retailers or third-party apps can contribute as well by using our API.
* We ask contributors to provide a proof of the price, in the form of a photo of the price tag or receipt. This is to make it easier to ensure data quality.
