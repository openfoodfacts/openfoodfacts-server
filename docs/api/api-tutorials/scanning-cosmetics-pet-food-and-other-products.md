### API Roadmap and multi-project behaviour
* We plan to bring the APIs mentionned above to Open Beauty Facts (Search-a-licious, Knowledge Panels, Open Prices, Robotoff, Folksonomy Engine)
* We plan to have a universal barcode scanning API, where you scan a barcode, and you get a result from either Open Food Facts, Open Pet Food Facts, Open Beauty Facts or Open Products Facts
* If no result is found in any of the 4 databases, you will have to ask the type of product to your users, and use the classic product addition API on the right project.
* If (it can happen) the product appears on the wrong project, we suggest you use the NutriPatrol API to let your users report it to the moderators, and the proceed to a product addition on the right project. The moderators will then move the existing data to the right project. Eventually, project categorization errors should be infinitesimal.

### Sample outputs
* Please use the Open Food Facts API reference for most operations (data and photo addition, ingredient lists, categories, labelsâ€¦)
