# How to download product images


All images can be found on [https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/](https://static.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/). Images of a product are stored in a single directory. The path of this directory can be inferred easily from the product barcode. If the product barcode length is lower or equal to 8 (ex: \"22222222\"), the directory path is simply the barcode: all images can be found on `https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/{barcode}`.
Otherwise, the following regex is used to split the barcode into subfolders: `r"^(...)(...)(...)(.*)$"`. For example, the barcode 3435660768163 is split as follows: 343/566/076/8163, and all images of the products can be found on
[https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/343/566/076/8163](https://images.openfoodfacts.org/images/products/343/566/076/8163).

To get the image file names, we have to use the database dump or the API. All images information are stored in the `images` field. For product [3168930010883](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v0/product/3168930010883.json), we have:

The keys of the map are the keys of the images. These keys can be:

-   digits: the image is the raw image sent by the contributor.
-   selected images: `front_{lang}`, `nutrition_{lang}` and `ingredients_{lang}`, selected as front, nutrition and ingredients
    images respectively for `lang`. Here, `lang` is a 2-letter ISO 639-1 language code (fr, en, es,\...).

Each image is available in different resolutions: \"100\", \"200\", \"400\" or \"full\", each corresponding to image height (\"full\" means
not resized). The available resolutions can be found in the `sizes` subfield.

Selected images have additional fields:

-   `rev` (as revision) indicates the revision number of the image to use (each time a new image is selected, cropped or rotated, a new image with an incremented rev is generated).
-   `imgid`, the image ID of the raw image used to generate the selected image.
-   `angle`, `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`: rotation angle and cropping coordinates.

For selected images, the file name is the image key followed by the revision number and the resolution: `front_fr.1.400.jpg`. For raw images, the file name is either the image ID (`1.jpg`) or the image ID followed by the resolution (`1.100.jpg`).

To get the full URL, simply concatenate the product directory path and the image name.

If you want to download a significant number of images, let us know before on our [Slack](https://slack.openfoodfacts.org/) and don\'t be too eager to keep our servers safe!
