# Providing knowledge panels for a particular Open Food Facts facet (category, brand, etc...)

The ["Knowledge Panel for Facets API"](https://facets-kp.openfoodfacts.org/docs) is a standardized way for clients to get semi-structured but generic data that they can present to users on facets pages (or potentially on product pages, if you click on a faceted value).

You can [contribute to the development on this repository](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/facets-knowledge-panels). This is a simple FastAPI Python backend.
