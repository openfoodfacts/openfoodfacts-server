### Important APIs if you want to scan any kind of product (or help your users avoid adding cosmetics by mistake in Open Food Facts)

* We have a universal barcode scanning API, where you scan a barcode, and you get a result from either Open Food Facts, Open Pet Food Facts, Open Beauty Facts or Open Products Facts with a `product_type` (beauty ┃ food ┃ petfood ┃ product), you can use the `product_type=all` parameter. Asked on any instance, it will redirect you to the right instance if a product exists and is on another instance (eg: asking for a beauty barcode on food instance). See [reference documentation](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/ref-v2/#get-/api/v2/product/-barcode-).
* https://world.openfoodfacts.org/api/v2/product/3760044183738?product_type=all (will redirect you to the proper payload on Open Products Facts)
* If no result is found in any of the 4 databases, you will have to ask the type of product to your users, and use the classic product addition API on the right project.
* If (it can happen) the product appears on the wrong project, we suggest you use the NutriPatrol API to let your users report it to the moderators, and the proceed to a product addition on the right project. The moderators will then move the existing data to the right project. Eventually, project categorization errors should be infinitesimal.

### API Roadmap and multi-project behaviour
* We plan to bring the APIs mentionned above to Open Beauty Facts (Search-a-licious, Knowledge Panels, Open Prices, Robotoff, Folksonomy Engine)

### Sample outputs
* Please use the Open Food Facts API reference for most operations (data and photo addition, ingredient lists, categories, labels…)

### WRITE Operations
* You can do WRITE operations on the right server, but normally all servers should forward operations automatically based on the `product_type`
* For cosmetic, the crucial thing we need is an ingredient photo
* For pet food, the crucial thing we need is an ingredient photo and a nutrition photo
* For other products, you should encourage the users to take photos of all angles of the packaging of the product, since variability is high across categories and there's a lot of information.
