The NutriPatrol API is used to report and manage issues with products and images on Open Food Facts, Open Prices, Open Pet Food Facts, Open Beauty Facts. We call a report a "flag" and a report will be associated with a "ticket" if it does not exist for this product or image. Otherwise it will be associated with the existing ticket.
