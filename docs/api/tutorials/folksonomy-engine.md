Folksonomy API

The Experimental Folksonomy API allows you to add and read information beyond the traditional product format to Open Food Facts, Open Products Facts, Open Pet Food Facts and Open Beauty Facts.  
The API is documented separately at [https://api.folksonomy.openfoodfacts.org/](https://api.folksonomy.openfoodfacts.org/)

Please be aware that there's a chance that all data added using this API could be deleted without notice, until we mark it as stable, due to unforeseen technical issues.
