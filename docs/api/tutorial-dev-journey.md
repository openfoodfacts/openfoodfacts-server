# Tutorial - developer journey

**Meet Dave.**

Dave is an active Open Food Facts **contributor** and a **developer** who wants to build **HealthyFoodChoices**, an Android app aimed at conscious consumers that buy healthy products.

**HealthyFoodChoices** will query Open Food Facts API and provide information on healthy foods available in the place users are living in. Users can narrow down the results by applying different filters and save their search criteria so that the app shows them the products that match their preferences next time they use it.

To identify the potential users' needs, Dave has met with some conscious consumers.

- **Anna** is a 25-year old New Yorker who **doesn't drink soda**, but **her nephew does**. She wants to **compare the nutrition facts of two cola brands**, and **its variants** (`diet`, `zero`, and so on) to decide which one to buy.
- **Stefano** is a 36-year old Italian who follows a **plant-based diet** and wants to **avoid the intake of palm oil**. He's looking for a **breakfast cereal brand** that does not use **palm oil** nor **additives** and has a **great nutriscore (A)**.
