  Each element object contains one specific element object such as a text element or an image element.
properties:
  type:
    element_type: string
    enum:
      - text
      - image
      - action
      - panel
      - panel_group

      The type of the included element object.
      The type also indicates which field contains the included element object.
      e.g. if the type is "text", the included element object will be in the "text_element" field.

      Note that in the future, new type of element may be added,
      so your code should ignore unrecognized types, and unknown properties.
