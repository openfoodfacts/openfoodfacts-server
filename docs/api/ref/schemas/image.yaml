        The available image sizes for the product (both reduced and full).
        The reduced images are the ones with numbers as the key( 100, 200 etc)
        while the full images have `full` as the key.

        This object represent an image that was uploaded to a product.
        "imgid" is an integer which is a sequential number unique to each picture.
      properties:
        imgid:
          type: integer
          example: 123456789

            If the image is selected as the front / ingredients / nutrition / packaging image,
            this is the index to access the original image URL in the `images` field of the product.
            If the image is not selected as one of these, this field is null.

            So if the product has the following `images` field:

            ```json
            "images": {
              1: { ... },
              front_en: { imgid: 1, ... },
              ...
            }
            ```

            then the front image can be accessed by `images[1]`.
