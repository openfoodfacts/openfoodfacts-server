  Nutrition fields of a product

  Most of these properties are read-only.

  See [how to add nutrition data](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/ref-cheatsheet/#add-nutrition-facts-values-units-and-base)
properties:
  no_nutrition_data:
    type: string
    description: |
      When a product does not have nutrition data displayed on the
      packaging, the user can check the field "Nutrition facts are
      not specified on the product".
      By doing so, the no_nutrition_data field takes the value "on".
      This case is frequent (thousands of products).
    example: "on"
  nutrition_data_per:
    type: string
    enum:
      - serving
      - 100g
    description: |
      The nutrition data on the package can be per serving or per 100g.

      This is essential to understand if `<nutrient>_value` and `<nutrient>`
      values in `nutriments` applies for a serving or for 100g.

      **IMPORTANT:**
      When writing products,
      this setting applies to all existing nutrients values for the product,
      not only the nutrient values sent in the write request.
      So it should not be changed unless all nutrients values are provided
      with values that match the nutrition_data_per field.
  nutrition_data_prepared_per:
    type: string
    enum:
      - serving
      - 100g
    description: |
      The nutrition data for prepared product on the package (if any) can be per serving or per 100g.

      This is essential to understand if `<nutrient>_prepared_value` and `<nutrient>_prepared`
      values in `nutriments` applies for a serving or for 100g.

      See also important note on `nutrition_data_per`.
  nutriments:
    type: object
    description: |
      All known nutrients for the product.

      Note that each nutrients are declined with a variety of suffixes like `_100g`, `_serving`,
      see patternProperties below.

      A specific `_unit` is the unit of the value that was entered by the contributor (a user or the manufacturer).
      It is not necessarily the unit that is printed on the product, as some apps may force specific units when writing nutrient values.

      Beware that some properties are to be interpreted based upon `nutrition_data_per` value.

      For most use cases, you should use the `<nutrient>_100g` or `<nutrient>_serving` fields, as they are always in the same standard unit, for a specific quantity (100g or 1 serving).

      For products that have a nutrition table for prepared product
      (eg. the nutrition facts for a bowl of milk with cocoa powder),
      a `_prepared` suffix is added (before other suffixes).

      You can get all possible nutrients from the
      [nutrients taxonomy](https://static.openfoodfacts.org/data/taxonomies/nutrients.json)

      **FIXME** add more nutrients with description.
