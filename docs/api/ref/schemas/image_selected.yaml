      description: |
        Images selected (and possibly cropped or rotated) to show an area of interest

          description: |
            The imgid of the original/source image edited (rotated, cropped, normalized etc) to produce the selected image.
            When uploading a new image and selecting it, the imgid will be automatically assigned by the server, and this field should not be passed.
            When selecting a previously uploaded image, the imgid must be passed to identify the source image.
        rev:
          type: integer
