        The `image_type` tells which image the url correspond to. `image_type` is `front` if not provided.

        The image is the one for current language (affected by `lc` parameter) if an image exists for this language, the image in main product language otherwise.

        **IMPORTANT:** you should use `selected_images` field instead of this one.
