      the URL of image of type `image_type` in size `image_size` (or full size if not given).

      The `image_type` tells which image the url correspond to. `image_type` is `front` if not provided.

      The image is the one for current language (affected by `lc` parameter) if an image exists for this language, the image in main product language otherwise.

      **IMPORTANT:** you should use `selected_images` field instead of this one.
