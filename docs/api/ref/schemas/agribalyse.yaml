    description: A general code for the product, often the same as agribalyse_food_code or an internal identifier.
    example: "13100"
  dqr:
    type: string
    description: Data Quality Rating (DQR) for the dataset. It's a score reflecting the reliability and representativeness of the data (e.g., "1.5 (P:1; TiR:2; GR:1; TeR:2; D:N/A)"). A lower score generally indicates higher quality. Specific components like P (Precision), TiR (Time Representativeness), GR (Geographical Representativeness), TeR (Technological Representativeness) might be detailed.
    example: "2.1 (P:2, TiR:3, GR:1.5, TeR:2)"
  ef_agriculture:
    type: number
    format: double
    description: Contribution of the agricultural production stage to the overall single environmental footprint score. Units depend on the EF method (e.g., mPt).
    example: 150
  ef_consumption:
    type: integer # TODO: Change from integer to number for consistency.
    format: double
    description: Contribution of the consumption stage to the overall single environmental footprint score.
    example: 30
  ef_distribution:
    type: number
    format: double
    description: Contribution of the distribution stage to the overall single environmental footprint score.
    example: 60
  ef_packaging:
    type: number
    format: double
    description: Contribution of the packaging to the overall single environmental footprint score.
    example: 90
  ef_processing:

    format: double
    description: Contribution of the food processing stage to the overall single environmental footprint score.
    example: 120
  ef_total:
    type: number
    format: double
    description: The overall single environmental footprint (EF) score for the product, aggregating multiple environmental impacts. This should ideally be the sum of the other ef_* fields. Units depend on the EF method (e.g., mPt - milliPoints).
    example: 470
