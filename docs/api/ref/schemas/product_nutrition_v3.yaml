            Fields related to the nutrition facts of a product

            Input nutrient sets can be updated directly with API v3.

            API v2 can still be used to update input sets for the default source (*packaging* on the public platform and *manufacturer* on the pro platform).

            aggregated_set:
              type: object
              description: | 
                A set that combines nutrient data from preferred sources, with normalized units, 
                and for a normalized 100g or 100ml quantity.
                
                It takes values from multiple sources (by priority: manufacturer, packaging, usda, estimate)
                and normalizes all values to the same unit: g for weights, kJ for energy and energy-kj, kcal for energy-kcal.

                The aggregated_set is read-only, and cannot be modified directly. It is computed from the other nutrient sets available for the product.

            input_sets:
              type: array
              description: |
                An array of nutrient sets of the product.

                Each nutrient set represents a version of the nutrition facts, defined by a combination of:
                - the source of the data (e.g. *packaging*, *manufacturer*, *estimate*).
                - the preparation state (e.g. *as_sold* or *prepared*),
                - the reference quantity (*per 100g*, *per 100ml* or *per serving*), and                

                This structure allows capturing multiple nutritional profiles for a single product.

                          The nutrition data on the package can be per serving, per 100g or per 100ml.

                          the actual quantity that defines one serving may vary between products 
                          and is stored in this field.

                          This is essential to understand to which quantity values in `nutrients` apply for.

                          For example, if the label states "per 250g", then this field should be *250*.
