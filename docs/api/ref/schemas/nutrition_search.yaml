      Search on nutrient lower than a value
    schema:
      type: object

        '(?<nutrient>\w+)(?<prepared>_prepared)?(?<portion>100g|serving)<(?<value>\d+)':

          description: |
            Will search for products with nutrients lower than  `value`
            per `portion` (100g or serving).

            If `prepared` is "prepared" search in prepared product instead of "as sold".

            Important: the parameter value is discarded and should be empty
      examples:
        - salt_100g_lt_2:
          summary: salt per 100g is lower than 2g (in product as sold)
          value:
            "salt_100g<2": 1

          value:

            Will search for products with nutrients exactl  the parameter value
