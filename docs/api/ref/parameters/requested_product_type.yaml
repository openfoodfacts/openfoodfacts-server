        Used for READ queries for one product. Expected product type of the requested product. Defaults to the product type of the server the query is sent to
        (e.g. 'food' for Open Food Facts, 'beauty' for Open Beauty Facts, etc.). 'all' matches all product types.
        If the product exists on a different server that matches the requested product type, the API will return a 302 redirect to the correct server.
        Otherwise, the API will return a 404 error.
        It is possible that new product types will be added in the future.
