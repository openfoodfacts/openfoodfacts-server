  title: Open Food Facts Open API V3 - under development
  description: |
    As a developer, the Open Food Facts API allows you to get information
    and contribute to the products database. You can create great apps to
    help people make better food choices and also provide data to enhance the database.

    **IMPORTANT**: Please read the [API introduction](https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/api/) before using this API.

    **WARNING** v3 is under development and you should expect changes

    The current version of API v3 is v3.2
    See the [change log for the API and product schema](../ref-api-and-product-schema-change-log.md)

      operationId: patch-api-v3-product-barcode
      description: |-
        This API allows to create or update a product (if the product already exists, its data is updated, otherwise it is created), or to analyze a test product (in which case no product is created or updated). To analyze a product, the "barcode" path component needs to contain the value "test" instead of a barcode.

        New API to send structured product data in a JSON format instead of in a flattened list of key / value pairs field as-in the current product add / edit API that relies on a multipart/form-data format.

        Important: this new Product WRITE API has been deployed in production, but it is still under development, and it may change.

        This new API is used in particular to send structured packaging data: https://openfoodfacts.github.io/openfoodfacts-server/dev/explain-packaging-data/

        The new API is gradually being extended to support other product fields.

        Currently supported fields are:
          - language specific fields (e.g. product name, ingredients text)
          - tags fields (e.g. categories, labels)
          - packaging fields (e.g. packagings, packagings_add, packagings_complete)
          - image selection of uploaded images (e.g. front, ingredients, nutrition, packaging) for specific languages

          Structured data for the product is passed in the product field.

          For complex structures such as the packagings object, it is possible to replace pre-existing data, or completing it:

          - an object sent in the packagings field will replace any pre-existing data.
          - an object sent in the field suffixed with _add (e.g. packagings_add) will be merged with any pre-existing data.

            - "none": no fields are returned.

            - "all": returns all fields except generated fields that need to be explicitly requested such as "knowledge_panels".

        Open Food Facts uses multilingual [taxonomies](https://wiki.openfoodfacts.org/Global_taxonomies) to normalize entries for categories, labels, ingredients, packaging shapes / materials / recycling instructions and many more fields.

        This API returns taxonomy entries suggestions that can be used in product edit forms, search forms etc. (for instance in autocomplete dropdowns using libraries like Tagify or select2 on the Web).

        Suggestions filtering:

        The string parameter allows to get only suggestions that contain a specific string (useful for autocomplete suggestions).

        Suggestions ordering:

        - For packaging shapes and materials, suggestions are ordered first by the number of packaging components they appear in (restricted by country, categories and shape (for materials) if they are passed as parameters).
        - for all other taxonomies, results are ordered alphabetically

        If a string is passed, an additional sort is done to put first suggestions that start with the string, followed by suggestions with a word that start with the string, and then suggestions that contain the string anywhere.
