      When an app uses a single user to log its contributions,
      it might be interesting to know which user of the app is providing the information.
      You can use this field to provide an identifier (eg: an sha1 of the username) that's privacy preserving. Make sure that your salt is strong, perfectly random and secret
  User-Agent:
    type: string
    description: |
      It is required that you pass a specific User-Agent header when you do an API request.
      But some times it's not possible to modify such a header
      (eg. request using JavaScript in a browser).
      In such cases, you can override it with this parameter.
