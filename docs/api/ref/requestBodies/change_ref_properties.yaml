      Adding meaningful comments help moderators and users understand a single product history.

      Name of the app providing the information
  app_version:
    type: string

      When an app uses a single user to log its contributions,
      it might be interesting to know which user of the app is providing the information.
      You can use this field to provide an identifier (eg: an sha1 of the username) that's privacy preserving. Make sure that your salt is strong, perfectly random and secret

      In case we have trouble with one of your user, it helps our moderators revert edits.
  User-Agent:
    type: string
    description: |
      It is required that you pass a specific User-Agent header when you do an API request.
      But some times it's not possible to modify such a header
      (eg. request using JavaScript in a browser).
      In such cases, you can override it with this parameter.
