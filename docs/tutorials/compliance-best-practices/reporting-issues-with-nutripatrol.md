The NutriPatrol API is used to **report and manage issues with products and images** on Open Food Facts, Open Prices, Open Pet Food Facts, Open Beauty Facts. We call a report a "flag" and a report will be associated with a "ticket" if it does not exist for this product or image. Otherwise it will be associated with the existing ticket.

- It's early days for this system. You can contribute to the development of the [Backend API](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/nutripatrol) and of the [Moderation Frontend](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/nutripatrol-frontend)
