# Event Schemas

This folder contains the schema definitions for the Redis events that Product Opener generates.

You can preview the schema in VSCode using the [asyncapi-preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asyncapi.asyncapi-preview) extension.

A pre-build HTML version of the document can be found [here](./openfoodfacts-server.html)
