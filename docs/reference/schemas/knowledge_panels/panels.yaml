  The panels object is a dictionary of individual panel objects.
  Each key of the dictionary is the id of the panel, and the value is the panel object.

  Apps typically display a number of root panels with known panel ids (e.g. health_card and environment_card). Panels can reference other panels and display them as sub-panels.
