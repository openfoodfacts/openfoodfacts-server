Dev Journey 6: Get ingredient related analysis on new or existing products (Nova, allergens, additivesâ€¦)

- If you can't get the information on a specific product, you can get your user to send photos and data.
- That will then be processed by Open Food Facts to get the computed result you want to show them.
- You can implement the complete flow so that they get immediately the result with some effort on their side.
- That will ensure user satisfaction

You can get information about absence or unawareness of the presence of:

- **palm oil**: `palm-oil-free`, `palm-oil`, `palm-oil-content-unknown`, `may-contain-palm-oil`
- **vegetarian ingredients**: `vegetarian`, `non-vegetarian`, `vegetarian-status-unknown`, `maybe-vegetarian`.
- **vegan ingredients**: `vegan`, `non-vegan`, `vegan-status-unknown`, `maybe-vegan`.
    
**Important!** Parsing might not be perfect and the ingredient detection might have issues in some languages.
