Basics
----------

The Open Food Facts software is developed collaboratively by hackers from all around the world.

We have a lot of development work to do:

- Open Food Facts backend (Perl and MongoDB);
- API (JSON);
- Web site (HTML5, JS, Foundation);
- iOS native (Swift);
- Android native (Java);
- Windows Phone and FirefoxOS apps (currently developed in HTML and JS with Apache Cordova / PhoneGap);
- Build new cool reuses etc...
- All our code is on GitHub : https://github.com/openfoodfacts/

Principle
----------

Our goal is to follow and keep few and simple guidelines.

- discuss the topics or issues or functionalities you want to work on. The slack workspace is the best choice for it.
- if not already done, open an issue on Github to explain the problem you want to solve or the functionality you want to work on.
- if you want to work on an existing issue, tell everyone in the issue's Github comments.
- fork the project and create one branch per issue or functionality you want to work on.
- It's cool to name a branch: issue/[issue_number]-[name]; ex.: issue/1630-name-of-the-issue
- When you're ready to propose something, send a "pull request"; be patient, sometimes it takes time to the core team to review pull request.
coding style is defined in the .editorconfig file, see https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server/blob/master/.editorconfig; many editors support EditorConfig, check yours: https://editorconfig.org
